scratch_space/kg_diagnosis.py


The kg_diagnosis.py script in your scratch_space directory is designed to diagnose the state of agent capabilities in your knowledge graph. Here’s a breakdown of what it does and how to use it:
What does kg_diagnosis.py do?
It performs a series of SPARQL queries against your knowledge graph to:
List all agents and their capabilities.
Show the distribution of capabilities (i.e., how many agents have each capability).
Identify agents missing required capabilities (specifically, CAP_A, CAP_B, CAP_C).
Detect potential capability conflicts (cases where multiple agents have the same capability, which may or may not be an issue depending on your design).
All results are logged using the loguru logger and returned as a dictionary.
How to use it
1. Make sure your environment is set up:
The script expects the knowledge graph to be accessible via the KnowledgeGraphManager.
Any required environment variables or configuration for the knowledge graph should be set.
2. Run the script from your terminal:
Apply to knowledgegra...
Run
py
3. What you’ll see:
The script will log information about:
The initialization of the knowledge graph.
The results of each diagnostic query (number of agent-capability pairs, capability distribution, missing required capabilities, and potential conflicts).
If you want to use the results programmatically, you can import and call diagnose_agent_capabilities() from another Python script.
Typical Output (in logs):
Number of agent-capability pairs found.
Capability distribution (how many agents have each capability).
List of agents missing required capabilities.
List of potential capability conflicts.
Summary Table
| Query/Check | What it Finds |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Agent Capabilities | Which agents have which capabilities |
| Capability Distribution | How many agents have each capability |
| Missing Required Capabilities | Agents missing CAP_A, CAP_B, or CAP_C |
| Capability Conflicts | Multiple agents with the same capability (potential issue)|
In short:
Run python scratch_space/kg_diagnosis.py to get a diagnostic overview of agent capabilities in your knowledge graph, with results logged for review and further action.
If you want to see example output or need help interpreting the results, let me know!
