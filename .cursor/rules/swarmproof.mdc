What does kg_swarm_proof.py do?
This script is designed to load sample data into your knowledge graph and run a comprehensive set of diagnostic SPARQL queries to check the health and structure of your agent/capability data. It provides a step-by-step, human-readable proof of the state of your knowledge graph, printing results directly to the terminal.
Key Functions:
Loads sample agents and capabilities into the knowledge graph for testing.
Runs a series of diagnostic queries to check for:
All triples in the graph (raw inspection).
Agent-capability relationships (which agents have which capabilities).
Agents with no capabilities (orphan agents).
Capabilities with incorrect RDF types (type validation).
Duplicate capability assignments (same capability assigned multiple times to an agent).
Capability change events (event propagation and logging).
Each section prints a clear header and the results of the query, making it easy to spot issues or confirm correct structure.
How to use it
1. Make sure your environment is set up:
The script expects the knowledge graph to be accessible via the KnowledgeGraphManager.
Any required environment variables or configuration for the knowledge graph should be set.
2. Run the script from your terminal:
Apply
Run
py
3. What you’ll see:
The script will print to the terminal:
All triples in the graph (for raw inspection).
Which agents have which capabilities.
Any agents with no capabilities.
Any capabilities with the wrong RDF type.
Any duplicate capability assignments.
Any capability change events.
Each section is clearly labeled for easy review.
Typical Output (in terminal):
Section headers (e.g., "Agents and Their Capabilities", "Duplicate Capability Assignments").
Lists of agents, capabilities, and any detected issues.
Confirmation messages if no issues are found (e.g., "All agents have at least one capability.").
Summary Table
| Section/Check | What it Finds |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| All Triples | Raw inspection of all triples in the graph |
| Agent-Capability Relationships | Which agents have which capabilities |
| Orphan Agents | Agents with no capabilities |
| Capability Type Validation | Capabilities with incorrect RDF types |
| Duplicate Assignments | Agents assigned the same capability more than once |
| Capability Change Events | Events indicating changes to agent capabilities |
In short:
Run python scratch_space/kg_swarm_proof.py to load sample data and get a step-by-step, human-readable diagnostic proof of your knowledge graph’s agent/capability structure.
