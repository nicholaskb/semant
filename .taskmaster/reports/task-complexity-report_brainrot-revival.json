			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Asset Ingestion Upgrade task into detailed implementation subtasks, including: (1) Analysis and preparation of existing codebase, (2) Implementation of ImageIngestionAgent integration with proper error handling, (3) Development of KG tagging functionality with metadata extraction, (4) Configuration and documentation updates, and (5) Testing and performance optimization. For each subtask, provide specific implementation steps, potential challenges, and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves refactoring an existing system to use a new agent, implementing KG tagging, and ensuring backward compatibility. The complexity is high (7/10) because it requires understanding the existing codebase, integrating a new component, implementing metadata extraction and tagging logic, and ensuring performance with proper error handling. The task touches multiple system components (ingestion system, KG API) and requires careful testing to avoid regressions."
