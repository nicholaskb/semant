## Update 2024-05-30: Agent Diary Integration & Knowledge Graph Enhancement

Dear CEO,

I'm pleased to report a major milestone for our semantic agent system:  
**Every agent's diary entries are now fully integrated into the knowledge graph.** This means you can reason over, query, and audit all agent diaries as part of our unified semantic infrastructure.

### What this enables:
- **Deep traceability:** Every significant agent action, state change, or "move" is now recorded and queryable in the knowledge graph.
- **Explainability:** You can audit the decision history and context for any agent, at any time.
- **Custom queries:** Leadership and compliance can now ask questions like "Show me all major moves by the Strategy Lead in Q2" or "List all diary entries related to client escalations."

### New Research Investigation Capabilities
We've added powerful research investigation capabilities to the system:
- **Topic Investigation:** Automatically gather and analyze all information about a research topic
- **Knowledge Graph Traversal:** Explore relationships between concepts in the knowledge graph
- **Confidence Scoring:** Get confidence scores for research findings based on evidence
- **Related Concept Discovery:** Find related concepts with similarity scores

### How you can use this:
- You can **modify the agent prompt** to request specific diary behaviors, e.g., "Log all client interactions" or "Summarize your week every Friday."
- If you'd like to try a custom prompt or scenario, please share your prompt with usâ€”we'll ensure the system responds and captures the right diary entries for your needs.
- You can now **investigate research topics** by asking questions like "What do we know about AI in healthcare?" or "Show me all research related to blockchain in supply chain."

### Example Queries You Can Now Run:
```sparql
# Find all diary entries for a specific agent
SELECT ?entry ?message ?timestamp
WHERE {
    ?agent dm:hasDiaryEntry ?entry .
    ?entry dm:message ?message ;
           dm:timestamp ?timestamp .
    FILTER(?agent = <agent:strategy_lead>)
}

# Find all client-related diary entries
SELECT ?agent ?entry ?message
WHERE {
    ?agent dm:hasDiaryEntry ?entry .
    ?entry dm:message ?message .
    FILTER(CONTAINS(?message, "client"))
}

# Find research papers related to a topic
SELECT ?paper ?title ?author ?year
WHERE {
    ?paper rdf:type dm:ResearchPaper ;
           dm:title ?title ;
           dm:author ?author ;
           dm:year ?year .
    ?paper dm:hasTopic ?topic .
    FILTER(CONTAINS(?topic, "AI healthcare"))
}

# Find related concepts with similarity scores
SELECT ?related ?score
WHERE {
    ?concept dm:relatedTo ?related .
    ?related dm:similarityScore ?score .
    FILTER(?score >= 0.7)
}
```

### Next steps:
If you have a specific prompt or scenario in mind, please share it with us. We'll demonstrate how the system captures, reasons over, and explains agent actions in real time. You can also try the new research investigation capabilities by asking about any topic of interest.

Thank you for your leadership and vision in making this level of transparency possible.

Best regards,  
Lead Architect, Semantic Agent Platform
