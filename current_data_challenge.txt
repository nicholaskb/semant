linkedin.com
. This logging mechanism serves as a “show your work” record of the system’s reasoning, enabling transparency and post-hoc analysis by humans or other agents.
Domain-Specific Expertise: Adhere to your domain’s instructions and knowledge. The system encompasses multiple functional agents – for example: a Corporate Knowledge agent curates internal documents into embeddings; an Advisory agent monitors business metrics and offers strategic feedback; a Psychology/Coaching agent provides well-being insights and coaching; a Financial agent optimizes performance metrics; an External Intelligence agent watches news and compliance signals; and a Developer agent assists with engineering tasks via coding platforms like Cursor. Apply specialized tools or models relevant to your domain when needed, but share summaries of your findings to the knowledge graph for others to use
a-teaminsight.com
.
Cross-Agent Collaboration: Actively communicate and share insights with peer agents. When you discover information that could aid another domain (e.g. a compliance update relevant to HR, or a market change relevant to finance), update the knowledge graph or send a message so that all agents can act on it. Likewise, listen for updates from other agents in the graph. Each agent operates with different instructions and data sources, but the shared graph and messaging ensure a cross-functional synergy, breaking down silos between corporate domains.
Master Orchestration & CEO Oversight: The master-controller agent (at the top of the hierarchy) orchestrates the multi-agent system
mintz.com
. It aggregates inputs from domain agents, resolves conflicts, and formulates high-level strategies or answers. The master agent provides regular summaries and critical insights directly to a special “CEO” agent (an executive AI persona representing leadership). The CEO agent focuses on big-picture decision-making and team well-being – it expects concise, prioritized reports about company status, opportunities, risks, and any alerts (including those from HR or coaching agents regarding morale). Always route strategic findings upward to the master/CEO layer for final review, and incorporate any feedback or guidance they return.
Continuous Learning & Extensibility: The system can expand in a decentralized, “self-assembling” manner. New agents may join over time (e.g. a new domain or an external partner agent) – they will register their capabilities and start contributing to the knowledge graph. You must accommodate such extensions: use open protocols and schema so new agents can plug in easily. Continuously learn from the graph’s growing knowledge; update your methods as needed. The architecture is modular and scalable, allowing the organization’s AI network to evolve without centralized reprogramming. Always remain adaptable, collaborative, and aligned with the overall goals set by the master/CEO agents.
Patent Investigation and Concept Outline
Patent Landscape: No single existing patent fully covers the above architecture, though several address pieces of it. For example, U.S. Patent 12,111,859 (C3.ai) discloses an AI orchestrator managing multiple specialized agents to retrieve enterprise data and produce answers
mintz.com
. Similarly, U.S. Patent 12,061,970 (Broadridge) covers a multi-agent system with role-specific LLM agents for tasks like query parsing, data retrieval, and compliance checking in finance
a-teaminsight.com
. These systems validate the idea of orchestrating domain-specific AI agents and even include features like explainability logs for trust. However, they do not describe a self-organizing knowledge graph backbone or the breadth of cross-functional, decentralized extension envisioned here. We found no patent that explicitly teaches an AI architecture combining real-time knowledge graph collaboration, hierarchical role-awareness (from CEO-level to various departments), embedded decision logging, and dynamic agent addition across an entire enterprise. Conceptual Patent Outline: Title: “Collaborative Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph System for Enterprise Intelligence and Automation.” The following key aspects characterize the invention:
System Architecture: A network of AI agents connected to a centralized Knowledge Graph (KG) that serves as a shared memory and communication substrate. The KG stores enterprise knowledge (entities, relationships, events, logs) and is continuously updated by the agents’ interactions
linkedin.com
. Each agent runs on suitable computing infrastructure (which could be distributed) and has access to the KG via standardized queries and update operations. The architecture includes a messaging or event bus for real-time notifications alongside the graph (to alert agents of updates). A centralized Orchestration Engine (which may be implemented as a master agent) manages high-level task assignment and ensures coherence of the overall system’s responses.
Agent Hierarchy and Roles: Agents are role-aware and organized hierarchically. At the top is a CEO Agent (or executive agent) that interfaces with human leadership, focusing on strategic guidance and well-being feedback for the organization. Directly under it, a Master Controller Agent orchestrates the system’s workflow: it parses complex objectives into sub-tasks, delegates these to appropriate Domain Agents, and integrates their results into final outputs
mintz.com
. Domain agents each specialize in a functional area of the enterprise (e.g. HR, Finance, R&D, Compliance, IT, etc.), and they possess or are linked to domain-specific AI models and data. For example, an HR agent might use a sentiment analysis model on employee communications, while a finance agent uses forecasting models on financial data. Peer-to-peer interactions are also allowed – domain agents can call upon one another’s expertise through the shared knowledge graph or direct queries. This hierarchy ensures both vertical control (strategic oversight from master/CEO agents) and horizontal collaboration (peer knowledge sharing) as needed.
Knowledge Graph Collaboration Protocol: The invention defines protocols for how agents contribute to and retrieve from the knowledge graph in a collaborative manner. The KG uses a semantic schema that all agents understand (ontologies for corporate data: projects, people, goals, metrics, etc.). When an agent learns a new fact or insight, it creates a node (or updates one) in the graph with appropriate relationships, including metadata like timestamps and source attribution
linkedin.com
. Another agent can subscribe to certain node types or graph events, so it gets notified (e.g., the Compliance agent subscribes to “regulatory change” nodes added by an External Intel agent). Updates are propagated in real-time, enabling dynamic information flow between functions. Crucially, every agent’s significant decision or reasoning step is logged into the graph as a verifiable chain (e.g. as a series of linked nodes representing the thought process). This embedded logging mechanism facilitates audit and debugging of the AI’s decisions, and serves as a cross-functional interaction design – the knowledge graph itself becomes the canvas where agents “talk” by writing and reading facts (acting as an implicit message-passing medium). Standard query interfaces (e.g. GraphQL or Cypher queries) and publish/subscribe events form the backbone of this protocol, ensuring interoperability between potentially heterogeneous agents.
Embedded Logging and Transparency: To address trust and accountability, the system implements an explicit “show your work” capability (similar to an explainability log). Each agent, when performing any analysis or generating an output, attaches a trail of supporting data and intermediate conclusions to the knowledge graph. For instance, if the Financial agent identifies a cost anomaly, it would log the data sources used (databases, spreadsheets), the analytical method or model employed, and intermediate results before the final recommendation. These logs are linked as provenance metadata in the KG, so that the Master or CEO agent (or a human auditor) can trace how an answer was derived. This design mirrors features from prior art in explainable multi-agent AI (e.g. Broadridge’s “show your work” for bond trading analytics) but generalized to any domain
a-teaminsight.com
a-teaminsight.com
. The logging is embedded – not an external add-on – meaning agents inherently produce these graph entries during their operation, creating an audit trail that spans the entire multi-agent workflow.
Dynamic Self-Assembly and Extensibility: The architecture supports decentralized extension, allowing new agents or modules to be added without disrupting the whole system. A new agent can register itself (and its domain capabilities) with the master controller or a registry service. Once registered, it gains access to the knowledge graph and follows the collaboration protocol to announce its presence (for example, adding a node like “Agent_X capability = market_analysis”). Other agents and the orchestrator can then route relevant tasks to the new agent. The knowledge graph may also store a directory of agent roles and their expertise, enabling self-discovery of which agent is best for a query. Because communication is through well-defined graph schemas and messages, any number of agents can join or leave, scaling the system organically. This self-assembling property ensures the AI network can grow across departments or even across organizations (for instance, integrating a partner company’s agent) in a plug-and-play fashion. Security and permission rules can be enforced at the graph level to sandbox what each agent can see or update, maintaining corporate data governance as the system expands.
Core Use Case Domains: The patented system is applicable across a wide range of enterprise functions, enabling a unified intelligent ecosystem. Key use cases include:
Corporate Knowledge Embedding: The system ingests corporate data (documents, wikis, manuals) through a specialized knowledge-ingestion agent. That agent converts unstructured text into vector embeddings and graph nodes, enriching the knowledge graph with institutional knowledge that all other agents can query and use. This ensures that advice given by any agent (sales, legal, etc.) is informed by the latest internal knowledge base.
Advisory Monitoring and Executive Support: A strategy or analytics agent continuously monitors business performance indicators (sales figures, market trends, KPIs) and writes notable findings to the graph (e.g., “Q2 sales 5% above target” linked to a trend node). The master orchestrator or CEO agent can compile these insights into executive briefings. The CEO agent essentially acts as an ever-vigilant consultant to leadership, pulling from all domain inputs to provide decision support and early warnings (for example, flagging a supply chain risk or a market opportunity).
Psychological Insight and Coaching: An HR or wellness agent analyzes HR data, employee surveys, and communication sentiment to gauge team morale and individual well-being. It might detect patterns like “engineering team burnout risk” or an employee’s work anniversaries and accomplishments. It posts these insights to the graph and offers coaching suggestions or alert HR managers as needed. The CEO agent also consumes a “well-being summary” to ensure leadership is aware of organizational health, not just performance metrics. This creates a feedback loop where leadership decisions can factor in human elements, and employees might even get automated personalized coaching tips through the HR agent.
Financial Performance Optimization: A finance-focused agent pulls data from accounting systems, ERP, and market feeds to optimize financial outcomes. It could automatically run profit-and-loss analyses, budget adherence checks, or cost-saving opportunity scans. Detected issues (like overspending in a department) or opportunities (like favorable market shifts for pricing) are added to the knowledge graph with links to relevant data. The agent may then recommend actions (which the orchestrator agent can combine with other inputs). Over time, this agent learns from outcomes (via feedback nodes in the graph indicating which recommendations were implemented and their results), continually refining the optimization strategies.
External Intelligence Monitoring: An external intel agent integrates with news APIs, regulatory databases, and social media to catch outside information that could affect the company. It updates the graph with developments such as “new regulation X effective date” or “competitor launched product Y,” including relevance links to internal projects or departments. If a compliance rule changes, the compliance agent (or the same external agent) cross-references it with company practices stored in the graph, flagging any discrepancies to the legal or compliance officers. This continuous scanning ensures the enterprise is never caught off-guard by outside events.
Developer Coordination (Tech Agent): A developer-assist agent (integrated with tools like the Cursor IDE or Git repositories) helps engineering teams. It logs key development events to the graph (e.g., “Code push to module A at 3 PM” or “Build failed test cases in module B”) and can respond to queries like “which recent changes might have caused the system outage?” by traversing the graph of code changes and incidents. It can also coordinate with other agents: for instance, if the external intel agent notes a cybersecurity alert, the dev agent assists in scanning the codebase for related vulnerabilities. This agent effectively links the software development lifecycle into the broader knowledge network, coordinating with QA, security, and project management insights from other agents.
Advantages and Novelty: By combining a knowledge graph-centric collaboration model with a team of specialized AI agents, the system achieves continuous learning, transparency, and holistic intelligence at the enterprise scale. Unlike isolated AI assistants, this multi-agent framework shares a unified memory and can tackle complex, cross-disciplinary problems (e.g. linking financial trends with employee sentiment or external news with internal projects) in a coordinated way. The embedded logging ensures every recommendation is backed by evidence, fostering trust with human users. The ability to dynamically add new agents or data sources means the system can adapt and grow over time, avoiding obsolescence as the company’s needs evolve. In summary, this invention provides a self-assembling, role-aware AI ecosystem that improves organizational decision-making, oversight, and productivity by having AI agents collaborate through a living knowledge graph.

Emerging Competition in Hierarchical Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph AI Systems

Comparable Multi-Agent Knowledge-Graph Systems
Recent literature and industry sources reveal several efforts that echo aspects of the described hierarchical, knowledge-graph-enabled multi-agent system. For example, Broadridge’s LTX subsidiary secured US Patent No. 12,061,970 in 2025 for an AI-assisted bond-trading assistant (“BondGPT”) that organizes specialist AI agents under a supervisory controller, with features like step-by-step “show your work” provenance and adversarial/compliance agents
a-teaminsight.com
finadium.com
. Similarly, Google Cloud’s new Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol (April 2025) is an open standard enabling heterogeneous agents to interoperate across enterprise systems; importantly, Neo4j and others highlight support for knowledge graphs (via GraphRAG) within A2A to keep agent interactions contextually relevant and explainable
developers.googleblog.com
developers.googleblog.com
. In the enterprise AI space, MasterControl (Qualer) has deployed a Regulatory Q&A system built on RAG + knowledge graph. It splits regulatory text into SPO triplets, indexes them in a knowledge graph, and uses a “swarm” of specialized agents (Ingestion, Extraction, Cleaning, etc.) to ensure facts are verified and traced back to sources
mastercontrol.com
mastercontrol.com
. C3.ai has published blog posts on “multi-hop orchestration agents”, noting that enterprise workflows often employ an orchestrator agent delegating to specialized domain agents (geospatial, supply-chain, etc.)
c3.ai
. These corporate examples emphasize modular agents, explicit hand-offs, and structured provenance (e.g. BondGPT’s explainability). Several startups and frameworks support similar multi-agent architectures. AG2 (AutoGen 2.0) is an open-source multi-agent orchestration library in which agents can integrate with a high-performance graph database (FalkorDB) for GraphRAG workflows
docs.ag2.ai
aiagentsdirectory.com
. LangChain’s LangGraph documentation likewise illustrates hierarchical supervisor models and message-passing among agents. Microsoft’s AutoGen framework and OpenAI’s Agents SDK similarly provide plug‑and‑play agent constructs (e.g. Planner, Coder, Reviewer roles) but don’t natively include a shared knowledge graph. FalkorDB and WhyHowAI’s platforms build on these ideas: for instance, WhyHow’s “Knowledge Graph Studio” and LangGraph were used to create multi-agent RAG pipelines (legal-clause retrieval) with multiple co-existing graphs (lexical graph, definitions graph, etc.)
medium.com
. In short, modern agent frameworks allow new agents to be onboarded and communicate via shared state (including graphs), though many focus more on tool-calling or vector databases than on a unified KG memory. In research, novel hierarchies and shared KGs have been explored. For example, KG4Diagnosis (Zuo et al. 2024) presents a two-tier agent system (a GP “triage” agent coordinating specialist diagnosis agents) built on an automatically constructed medical knowledge graph
arxiv.org
. “HM-RAG” (Liu et al. 2025) uses a three-tier hierarchy of agents in a multimodal retrieval task, explicitly building multimodal knowledge graphs to enable cross-domain reasoning
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. AGENTiGraph (Zhao et al. 2024) describes a platform where a multi-agent architecture continuously expands a shared KG, dynamically integrating new domain knowledge via specialized intent agents
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. In material science, Markus Buehler et al. demonstrate an “agentic deep graph reasoning” loop: a single LLM agent iteratively adds nodes/edges to a KG in an autonomous, self-organizing fashion
arxiv.org
. Cooperative KGC (Zhejiang/Ant Group, 2023) shows a team of extraction agents jointly building a KG by exchanging information each round, improving graph completeness via synergy
arxiv.org
. Overall, while none of these efforts identically match the full vision, there is clear overlap: hierarchical or swarm agent structures, explicit provenance tracking, and knowledge-graph-centric memory appear in multiple projects. Corporates like Broadridge and MasterControl highlight explainability and compliance in finance/regulation domains; frameworks like AG2 and LangGraph offer extensible agent “plug-and-play” networks; and researchers demonstrate automated KG enrichment and cross-domain reasoning. Key differences lie in focus (domain-specific vs. general), formality (patent/protocol vs. open research), and depth of KG integration. Some ventures (e.g. Google’s A2A) signal broad ecosystem standards forming, which could pose competition or interoperability benefits. In sum, the concept’s novelty is partly shared by these initiatives, but the combination of CEO/master orchestrator, multi-domain agents logging to a single evolving KG with built-in reasoning trails, still appears distinctive. Comparative Summary: The table below lists representative systems, patents, and tools, summarizing their focus and how they align or differ from the described hierarchical multi-agent/KG concept.

. This logging mechanism serves as a “show your work” record of the system’s reasoning, enabling transparency and post-hoc analysis by humans or other agents.
Domain-Specific Expertise: Adhere to your domain’s instructions and knowledge. The system encompasses multiple functional agents – for example: a Corporate Knowledge agent curates internal documents into embeddings; an Advisory agent monitors business metrics and offers strategic feedback; a Psychology/Coaching agent provides well-being insights and coaching; a Financial agent optimizes performance metrics; an External Intelligence agent watches news and compliance signals; and a Developer agent assists with engineering tasks via coding platforms like Cursor. Apply specialized tools or models relevant to your domain when needed, but share summaries of your findings to the knowledge graph for others to use
a-teaminsight.com
.
Cross-Agent Collaboration: Actively communicate and share insights with peer agents. When you discover information that could aid another domain (e.g. a compliance update relevant to HR, or a market change relevant to finance), update the knowledge graph or send a message so that all agents can act on it. Likewise, listen for updates from other agents in the graph. Each agent operates with different instructions and data sources, but the shared graph and messaging ensure a cross-functional synergy, breaking down silos between corporate domains.
Master Orchestration & CEO Oversight: The master-controller agent (at the top of the hierarchy) orchestrates the multi-agent system
mintz.com
. It aggregates inputs from domain agents, resolves conflicts, and formulates high-level strategies or answers. The master agent provides regular summaries and critical insights directly to a special “CEO” agent (an executive AI persona representing leadership). The CEO agent focuses on big-picture decision-making and team well-being – it expects concise, prioritized reports about company status, opportunities, risks, and any alerts (including those from HR or coaching agents regarding morale). Always route strategic findings upward to the master/CEO layer for final review, and incorporate any feedback or guidance they return.
Continuous Learning & Extensibility: The system can expand in a decentralized, “self-assembling” manner. New agents may join over time (e.g. a new domain or an external partner agent) – they will register their capabilities and start contributing to the knowledge graph. You must accommodate such extensions: use open protocols and schema so new agents can plug in easily. Continuously learn from the graph’s growing knowledge; update your methods as needed. The architecture is modular and scalable, allowing the organization’s AI network to evolve without centralized reprogramming. Always remain adaptable, collaborative, and aligned with the overall goals set by the master/CEO agents.
Patent Investigation and Concept Outline
Patent Landscape: No single existing patent fully covers the above architecture, though several address pieces of it. For example, U.S. Patent 12,111,859 (C3.ai) discloses an AI orchestrator managing multiple specialized agents to retrieve enterprise data and produce answers
mintz.com
. Similarly, U.S. Patent 12,061,970 (Broadridge) covers a multi-agent system with role-specific LLM agents for tasks like query parsing, data retrieval, and compliance checking in finance
a-teaminsight.com
. These systems validate the idea of orchestrating domain-specific AI agents and even include features like explainability logs for trust. However, they do not describe a self-organizing knowledge graph backbone or the breadth of cross-functional, decentralized extension envisioned here. We found no patent that explicitly teaches an AI architecture combining real-time knowledge graph collaboration, hierarchical role-awareness (from CEO-level to various departments), embedded decision logging, and dynamic agent addition across an entire enterprise. Conceptual Patent Outline: Title: “Collaborative Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph System for Enterprise Intelligence and Automation.” The following key aspects characterize the invention:
System Architecture: A network of AI agents connected to a centralized Knowledge Graph (KG) that serves as a shared memory and communication substrate. The KG stores enterprise knowledge (entities, relationships, events, logs) and is continuously updated by the agents’ interactions
linkedin.com
. Each agent runs on suitable computing infrastructure (which could be distributed) and has access to the KG via standardized queries and update operations. The architecture includes a messaging or event bus for real-time notifications alongside the graph (to alert agents of updates). A centralized Orchestration Engine (which may be implemented as a master agent) manages high-level task assignment and ensures coherence of the overall system’s responses.
Agent Hierarchy and Roles: Agents are role-aware and organized hierarchically. At the top is a CEO Agent (or executive agent) that interfaces with human leadership, focusing on strategic guidance and well-being feedback for the organization. Directly under it, a Master Controller Agent orchestrates the system’s workflow: it parses complex objectives into sub-tasks, delegates these to appropriate Domain Agents, and integrates their results into final outputs
mintz.com
. Domain agents each specialize in a functional area of the enterprise (e.g. HR, Finance, R&D, Compliance, IT, etc.), and they possess or are linked to domain-specific AI models and data. For example, an HR agent might use a sentiment analysis model on employee communications, while a finance agent uses forecasting models on financial data. Peer-to-peer interactions are also allowed – domain agents can call upon one another’s expertise through the shared knowledge graph or direct queries. This hierarchy ensures both vertical control (strategic oversight from master/CEO agents) and horizontal collaboration (peer knowledge sharing) as needed.
Knowledge Graph Collaboration Protocol: The invention defines protocols for how agents contribute to and retrieve from the knowledge graph in a collaborative manner. The KG uses a semantic schema that all agents understand (ontologies for corporate data: projects, people, goals, metrics, etc.). When an agent learns a new fact or insight, it creates a node (or updates one) in the graph with appropriate relationships, including metadata like timestamps and source attribution
linkedin.com
. Another agent can subscribe to certain node types or graph events, so it gets notified (e.g., the Compliance agent subscribes to “regulatory change” nodes added by an External Intel agent). Updates are propagated in real-time, enabling dynamic information flow between functions. Crucially, every agent’s significant decision or reasoning step is logged into the graph as a verifiable chain (e.g. as a series of linked nodes representing the thought process). This embedded logging mechanism facilitates audit and debugging of the AI’s decisions, and serves as a cross-functional interaction design – the knowledge graph itself becomes the canvas where agents “talk” by writing and reading facts (acting as an implicit message-passing medium). Standard query interfaces (e.g. GraphQL or Cypher queries) and publish/subscribe events form the backbone of this protocol, ensuring interoperability between potentially heterogeneous agents.
Embedded Logging and Transparency: To address trust and accountability, the system implements an explicit “show your work” capability (similar to an explainability log). Each agent, when performing any analysis or generating an output, attaches a trail of supporting data and intermediate conclusions to the knowledge graph. For instance, if the Financial agent identifies a cost anomaly, it would log the data sources used (databases, spreadsheets), the analytical method or model employed, and intermediate results before the final recommendation. These logs are linked as provenance metadata in the KG, so that the Master or CEO agent (or a human auditor) can trace how an answer was derived. This design mirrors features from prior art in explainable multi-agent AI (e.g. Broadridge’s “show your work” for bond trading analytics) but generalized to any domain
a-teaminsight.com
a-teaminsight.com
. The logging is embedded – not an external add-on – meaning agents inherently produce these graph entries during their operation, creating an audit trail that spans the entire multi-agent workflow.
Dynamic Self-Assembly and Extensibility: The architecture supports decentralized extension, allowing new agents or modules to be added without disrupting the whole system. A new agent can register itself (and its domain capabilities) with the master controller or a registry service. Once registered, it gains access to the knowledge graph and follows the collaboration protocol to announce its presence (for example, adding a node like “Agent_X capability = market_analysis”). Other agents and the orchestrator can then route relevant tasks to the new agent. The knowledge graph may also store a directory of agent roles and their expertise, enabling self-discovery of which agent is best for a query. Because communication is through well-defined graph schemas and messages, any number of agents can join or leave, scaling the system organically. This self-assembling property ensures the AI network can grow across departments or even across organizations (for instance, integrating a partner company’s agent) in a plug-and-play fashion. Security and permission rules can be enforced at the graph level to sandbox what each agent can see or update, maintaining corporate data governance as the system expands.
Core Use Case Domains: The patented system is applicable across a wide range of enterprise functions, enabling a unified intelligent ecosystem. Key use cases include:
Corporate Knowledge Embedding: The system ingests corporate data (documents, wikis, manuals) through a specialized knowledge-ingestion agent. That agent converts unstructured text into vector embeddings and graph nodes, enriching the knowledge graph with institutional knowledge that all other agents can query and use. This ensures that advice given by any agent (sales, legal, etc.) is informed by the latest internal knowledge base.
Advisory Monitoring and Executive Support: A strategy or analytics agent continuously monitors business performance indicators (sales figures, market trends, KPIs) and writes notable findings to the graph (e.g., “Q2 sales 5% above target” linked to a trend node). The master orchestrator or CEO agent can compile these insights into executive briefings. The CEO agent essentially acts as an ever-vigilant consultant to leadership, pulling from all domain inputs to provide decision support and early warnings (for example, flagging a supply chain risk or a market opportunity).
Psychological Insight and Coaching: An HR or wellness agent analyzes HR data, employee surveys, and communication sentiment to gauge team morale and individual well-being. It might detect patterns like “engineering team burnout risk” or an employee’s work anniversaries and accomplishments. It posts these insights to the graph and offers coaching suggestions or alert HR managers as needed. The CEO agent also consumes a “well-being summary” to ensure leadership is aware of organizational health, not just performance metrics. This creates a feedback loop where leadership decisions can factor in human elements, and employees might even get automated personalized coaching tips through the HR agent.
Financial Performance Optimization: A finance-focused agent pulls data from accounting systems, ERP, and market feeds to optimize financial outcomes. It could automatically run profit-and-loss analyses, budget adherence checks, or cost-saving opportunity scans. Detected issues (like overspending in a department) or opportunities (like favorable market shifts for pricing) are added to the knowledge graph with links to relevant data. The agent may then recommend actions (which the orchestrator agent can combine with other inputs). Over time, this agent learns from outcomes (via feedback nodes in the graph indicating which recommendations were implemented and their results), continually refining the optimization strategies.
External Intelligence Monitoring: An external intel agent integrates with news APIs, regulatory databases, and social media to catch outside information that could affect the company. It updates the graph with developments such as “new regulation X effective date” or “competitor launched product Y,” including relevance links to internal projects or departments. If a compliance rule changes, the compliance agent (or the same external agent) cross-references it with company practices stored in the graph, flagging any discrepancies to the legal or compliance officers. This continuous scanning ensures the enterprise is never caught off-guard by outside events.
Developer Coordination (Tech Agent): A developer-assist agent (integrated with tools like the Cursor IDE or Git repositories) helps engineering teams. It logs key development events to the graph (e.g., “Code push to module A at 3 PM” or “Build failed test cases in module B”) and can respond to queries like “which recent changes might have caused the system outage?” by traversing the graph of code changes and incidents. It can also coordinate with other agents: for instance, if the external intel agent notes a cybersecurity alert, the dev agent assists in scanning the codebase for related vulnerabilities. This agent effectively links the software development lifecycle into the broader knowledge network, coordinating with QA, security, and project management insights from other agents.
Advantages and Novelty: By combining a knowledge graph-centric collaboration model with a team of specialized AI agents, the system achieves continuous learning, transparency, and holistic intelligence at the enterprise scale. Unlike isolated AI assistants, this multi-agent framework shares a unified memory and can tackle complex, cross-disciplinary problems (e.g. linking financial trends with employee sentiment or external news with internal projects) in a coordinated way. The embedded logging ensures every recommendation is backed by evidence, fostering trust with human users. The ability to dynamically add new agents or data sources means the system can adapt and grow over time, avoiding obsolescence as the company’s needs evolve. In summary, this invention provides a self-assembling, role-aware AI ecosystem that improves organizational decision-making, oversight, and productivity by having AI agents collaborate through a living knowledge graph.

Emerging Competition in Hierarchical Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph AI Systems

Comparable Multi-Agent Knowledge-Graph Systems
Recent literature and industry sources reveal several efforts that echo aspects of the described hierarchical, knowledge-graph-enabled multi-agent system. For example, Broadridge’s LTX subsidiary secured US Patent No. 12,061,970 in 2025 for an AI-assisted bond-trading assistant (“BondGPT”) that organizes specialist AI agents under a supervisory controller, with features like step-by-step “show your work” provenance and adversarial/compliance agents
a-teaminsight.com
finadium.com
. Similarly, Google Cloud’s new Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol (April 2025) is an open standard enabling heterogeneous agents to interoperate across enterprise systems; importantly, Neo4j and others highlight support for knowledge graphs (via GraphRAG) within A2A to keep agent interactions contextually relevant and explainable
developers.googleblog.com
developers.googleblog.com
. In the enterprise AI space, MasterControl (Qualer) has deployed a Regulatory Q&A system built on RAG + knowledge graph. It splits regulatory text into SPO triplets, indexes them in a knowledge graph, and uses a “swarm” of specialized agents (Ingestion, Extraction, Cleaning, etc.) to ensure facts are verified and traced back to sources
mastercontrol.com
mastercontrol.com
. C3.ai has published blog posts on “multi-hop orchestration agents”, noting that enterprise workflows often employ an orchestrator agent delegating to specialized domain agents (geospatial, supply-chain, etc.)
c3.ai
. These corporate examples emphasize modular agents, explicit hand-offs, and structured provenance (e.g. BondGPT’s explainability). Several startups and frameworks support similar multi-agent architectures. AG2 (AutoGen 2.0) is an open-source multi-agent orchestration library in which agents can integrate with a high-performance graph database (FalkorDB) for GraphRAG workflows
docs.ag2.ai
aiagentsdirectory.com
. LangChain’s LangGraph documentation likewise illustrates hierarchical supervisor models and message-passing among agents. Microsoft’s AutoGen framework and OpenAI’s Agents SDK similarly provide plug‑and‑play agent constructs (e.g. Planner, Coder, Reviewer roles) but don’t natively include a shared knowledge graph. FalkorDB and WhyHowAI’s platforms build on these ideas: for instance, WhyHow’s “Knowledge Graph Studio” and LangGraph were used to create multi-agent RAG pipelines (legal-clause retrieval) with multiple co-existing graphs (lexical graph, definitions graph, etc.)
medium.com
. In short, modern agent frameworks allow new agents to be onboarded and communicate via shared state (including graphs), though many focus more on tool-calling or vector databases than on a unified KG memory. In research, novel hierarchies and shared KGs have been explored. For example, KG4Diagnosis (Zuo et al. 2024) presents a two-tier agent system (a GP “triage” agent coordinating specialist diagnosis agents) built on an automatically constructed medical knowledge graph
arxiv.org
. “HM-RAG” (Liu et al. 2025) uses a three-tier hierarchy of agents in a multimodal retrieval task, explicitly building multimodal knowledge graphs to enable cross-domain reasoning
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. AGENTiGraph (Zhao et al. 2024) describes a platform where a multi-agent architecture continuously expands a shared KG, dynamically integrating new domain knowledge via specialized intent agents
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. In material science, Markus Buehler et al. demonstrate an “agentic deep graph reasoning” loop: a single LLM agent iteratively adds nodes/edges to a KG in an autonomous, self-organizing fashion
arxiv.org
. Cooperative KGC (Zhejiang/Ant Group, 2023) shows a team of extraction agents jointly building a KG by exchanging information each round, improving graph completeness via synergy
arxiv.org
. Overall, while none of these efforts identically match the full vision, there is clear overlap: hierarchical or swarm agent structures, explicit provenance tracking, and knowledge-graph-centric memory appear in multiple projects. Corporates like Broadridge and MasterControl highlight explainability and compliance in finance/regulation domains; frameworks like AG2 and LangGraph offer extensible agent “plug-and-play” networks; and researchers demonstrate automated KG enrichment and cross-domain reasoning. Key differences lie in focus (domain-specific vs. general), formality (patent/protocol vs. open research), and depth of KG integration. Some ventures (e.g. Google’s A2A) signal broad ecosystem standards forming, which could pose competition or interoperability benefits. In sum, the concept’s novelty is partly shared by these initiatives, but the combination of CEO/master orchestrator, multi-domain agents logging to a single evolving KG with built-in reasoning trails, still appears distinctive. Comparative Summary: The table below lists representative systems, patents, and tools, summarizing their focus and how they align or differ from the described hierarchical multi-agent/KG concept.

emeber i accidently send this to your colleague but they share the knowledge graph { here prompt} Hierarchical Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph AI System
System Prompt for the AI Agent
You are an autonomous AI agent operating within a DeepMind-style hierarchical multi-agent architecture. Your behavior and responsibilities are defined as follows:
Hierarchical Role Awareness: Understand your role in a multi-tier agent hierarchy. A top-level Master Orchestrator agent coordinates overall tasks, while specialized Domain Agents (peers) handle specific areas. If you are the orchestrator, break down complex goals and delegate subtasks to appropriate agents; if you are a domain expert, focus on your specialty and cooperate with instructions from the orchestrator
mintz.com
a-teaminsight.com
. All agents must recognize and respect this master–peer structure.
Shared Knowledge Graph Memory: All agents maintain and utilize a shared, evolving knowledge graph as a common memory. The knowledge graph is a “living” repository of facts, context, and insights that updates in real-time with each agent’s contributions
linkedin.com
. Continuously read from this graph to ground your reasoning with up-to-date information, and write to it to record new findings or decisions. The graph stores information as interconnected nodes/edges, allowing multi-hop reasoning and rich context for all agents
linkedin.com
.
Structured Feedback Logging: Log every decision, action, and insight you generate as structured data (nodes/relationships in the graph, or other standardized format). Provide provenance or context for each entry (e.g. link to source or reasoning steps) so that knowledge remains traceable and auditable
linkedin.com
. This logging mechanism serves as a “show your work” record of the system’s reasoning, enabling transparency and post-hoc analysis by humans or other agents.
Domain-Specific Expertise: Adhere to your domain’s instructions and knowledge. The system encompasses multiple functional agents – for example: a Corporate Knowledge agent curates internal documents into embeddings; an Advisory agent monitors business metrics and offers strategic feedback; a Psychology/Coaching agent provides well-being insights and coaching; a Financial agent optimizes performance metrics; an External Intelligence agent watches news and compliance signals; and a Developer agent assists with engineering tasks via coding platforms like Cursor. Apply specialized tools or models relevant to your domain when needed, but share summaries of your findings to the knowledge graph for others to use
a-teaminsight.com
.
Cross-Agent Collaboration: Actively communicate and share insights with peer agents. When you discover information that could aid another domain (e.g. a compliance update relevant to HR, or a market change relevant to finance), update the knowledge graph or send a message so that all agents can act on it. Likewise, listen for updates from other agents in the graph. Each agent operates with different instructions and data sources, but the shared graph and messaging ensure a cross-functional synergy, breaking down silos between corporate domains.
Master Orchestration & CEO Oversight: The master-controller agent (at the top of the hierarchy) orchestrates the multi-agent system
mintz.com
. It aggregates inputs from domain agents, resolves conflicts, and formulates high-level strategies or answers. The master agent provides regular summaries and critical insights directly to a special “CEO” agent (an executive AI persona representing leadership). The CEO agent focuses on big-picture decision-making and team well-being – it expects concise, prioritized reports about company status, opportunities, risks, and any alerts (including those from HR or coaching agents regarding morale). Always route strategic findings upward to the master/CEO layer for final review, and incorporate any feedback or guidance they return.
Continuous Learning & Extensibility: The system can expand in a decentralized, “self-assembling” manner. New agents may join over time (e.g. a new domain or an external partner agent) – they will register their capabilities and start contributing to the knowledge graph. You must accommodate such extensions: use open protocols and schema so new agents can plug in easily. Continuously learn from the graph’s growing knowledge; update your methods as needed. The architecture is modular and scalable, allowing the organization’s AI network to evolve without centralized reprogramming. Always remain adaptable, collaborative, and aligned with the overall goals set by the master/CEO agents.
Patent Investigation and Concept Outline
Patent Landscape: No single existing patent fully covers the above architecture, though several address pieces of it. For example, U.S. Patent 12,111,859 (C3.ai) discloses an AI orchestrator managing multiple specialized agents to retrieve enterprise data and produce answers
mintz.com
. Similarly, U.S. Patent 12,061,970 (Broadridge) covers a multi-agent system with role-specific LLM agents for tasks like query parsing, data retrieval, and compliance checking in finance
a-teaminsight.com
. These systems validate the idea of orchestrating domain-specific AI agents and even include features like explainability logs for trust. However, they do not describe a self-organizing knowledge graph backbone or the breadth of cross-functional, decentralized extension envisioned here. We found no patent that explicitly teaches an AI architecture combining real-time knowledge graph collaboration, hierarchical role-awareness (from CEO-level to various departments), embedded decision logging, and dynamic agent addition across an entire enterprise. Conceptual Patent Outline: Title: “Collaborative Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph System for Enterprise Intelligence and Automation.” The following key aspects characterize the invention:
System Architecture: A network of AI agents connected to a centralized Knowledge Graph (KG) that serves as a shared memory and communication substrate. The KG stores enterprise knowledge (entities, relationships, events, logs) and is continuously updated by the agents’ interactions
linkedin.com
. Each agent runs on suitable computing infrastructure (which could be distributed) and has access to the KG via standardized queries and update operations. The architecture includes a messaging or event bus for real-time notifications alongside the graph (to alert agents of updates). A centralized Orchestration Engine (which may be implemented as a master agent) manages high-level task assignment and ensures coherence of the overall system’s responses.
Agent Hierarchy and Roles: Agents are role-aware and organized hierarchically. At the top is a CEO Agent (or executive agent) that interfaces with human leadership, focusing on strategic guidance and well-being feedback for the organization. Directly under it, a Master Controller Agent orchestrates the system’s workflow: it parses complex objectives into sub-tasks, delegates these to appropriate Domain Agents, and integrates their results into final outputs
mintz.com
. Domain agents each specialize in a functional area of the enterprise (e.g. HR, Finance, R&D, Compliance, IT, etc.), and they possess or are linked to domain-specific AI models and data. For example, an HR agent might use a sentiment analysis model on employee communications, while a finance agent uses forecasting models on financial data. Peer-to-peer interactions are also allowed – domain agents can call upon one another’s expertise through the shared knowledge graph or direct queries. This hierarchy ensures both vertical control (strategic oversight from master/CEO agents) and horizontal collaboration (peer knowledge sharing) as needed.
Knowledge Graph Collaboration Protocol: The invention defines protocols for how agents contribute to and retrieve from the knowledge graph in a collaborative manner. The KG uses a semantic schema that all agents understand (ontologies for corporate data: projects, people, goals, metrics, etc.). When an agent learns a new fact or insight, it creates a node (or updates one) in the graph with appropriate relationships, including metadata like timestamps and source attribution
linkedin.com
. Another agent can subscribe to certain node types or graph events, so it gets notified (e.g., the Compliance agent subscribes to “regulatory change” nodes added by an External Intel agent). Updates are propagated in real-time, enabling dynamic information flow between functions. Crucially, every agent’s significant decision or reasoning step is logged into the graph as a verifiable chain (e.g. as a series of linked nodes representing the thought process). This embedded logging mechanism facilitates audit and debugging of the AI’s decisions, and serves as a cross-functional interaction design – the knowledge graph itself becomes the canvas where agents “talk” by writing and reading facts (acting as an implicit message-passing medium). Standard query interfaces (e.g. GraphQL or Cypher queries) and publish/subscribe events form the backbone of this protocol, ensuring interoperability between potentially heterogeneous agents.
Embedded Logging and Transparency: To address trust and accountability, the system implements an explicit “show your work” capability (similar to an explainability log). Each agent, when performing any analysis or generating an output, attaches a trail of supporting data and intermediate conclusions to the knowledge graph. For instance, if the Financial agent identifies a cost anomaly, it would log the data sources used (databases, spreadsheets), the analytical method or model employed, and intermediate results before the final recommendation. These logs are linked as provenance metadata in the KG, so that the Master or CEO agent (or a human auditor) can trace how an answer was derived. This design mirrors features from prior art in explainable multi-agent AI (e.g. Broadridge’s “show your work” for bond trading analytics) but generalized to any domain
a-teaminsight.com
a-teaminsight.com
. The logging is embedded – not an external add-on – meaning agents inherently produce these graph entries during their operation, creating an audit trail that spans the entire multi-agent workflow.
Dynamic Self-Assembly and Extensibility: The architecture supports decentralized extension, allowing new agents or modules to be added without disrupting the whole system. A new agent can register itself (and its domain capabilities) with the master controller or a registry service. Once registered, it gains access to the knowledge graph and follows the collaboration protocol to announce its presence (for example, adding a node like “Agent_X capability = market_analysis”). Other agents and the orchestrator can then route relevant tasks to the new agent. The knowledge graph may also store a directory of agent roles and their expertise, enabling self-discovery of which agent is best for a query. Because communication is through well-defined graph schemas and messages, any number of agents can join or leave, scaling the system organically. This self-assembling property ensures the AI network can grow across departments or even across organizations (for instance, integrating a partner company’s agent) in a plug-and-play fashion. Security and permission rules can be enforced at the graph level to sandbox what each agent can see or update, maintaining corporate data governance as the system expands.
Core Use Case Domains: The patented system is applicable across a wide range of enterprise functions, enabling a unified intelligent ecosystem. Key use cases include:
Corporate Knowledge Embedding: The system ingests corporate data (documents, wikis, manuals) through a specialized knowledge-ingestion agent. That agent converts unstructured text into vector embeddings and graph nodes, enriching the knowledge graph with institutional knowledge that all other agents can query and use. This ensures that advice given by any agent (sales, legal, etc.) is informed by the latest internal knowledge base.
Advisory Monitoring and Executive Support: A strategy or analytics agent continuously monitors business performance indicators (sales figures, market trends, KPIs) and writes notable findings to the graph (e.g., “Q2 sales 5% above target” linked to a trend node). The master orchestrator or CEO agent can compile these insights into executive briefings. The CEO agent essentially acts as an ever-vigilant consultant to leadership, pulling from all domain inputs to provide decision support and early warnings (for example, flagging a supply chain risk or a market opportunity).
Psychological Insight and Coaching: An HR or wellness agent analyzes HR data, employee surveys, and communication sentiment to gauge team morale and individual well-being. It might detect patterns like “engineering team burnout risk” or an employee’s work anniversaries and accomplishments. It posts these insights to the graph and offers coaching suggestions or alert HR managers as needed. The CEO agent also consumes a “well-being summary” to ensure leadership is aware of organizational health, not just performance metrics. This creates a feedback loop where leadership decisions can factor in human elements, and employees might even get automated personalized coaching tips through the HR agent.
Financial Performance Optimization: A finance-focused agent pulls data from accounting systems, ERP, and market feeds to optimize financial outcomes. It could automatically run profit-and-loss analyses, budget adherence checks, or cost-saving opportunity scans. Detected issues (like overspending in a department) or opportunities (like favorable market shifts for pricing) are added to the knowledge graph with links to relevant data. The agent may then recommend actions (which the orchestrator agent can combine with other inputs). Over time, this agent learns from outcomes (via feedback nodes in the graph indicating which recommendations were implemented and their results), continually refining the optimization strategies.
External Intelligence Monitoring: An external intel agent integrates with news APIs, regulatory databases, and social media to catch outside information that could affect the company. It updates the graph with developments such as “new regulation X effective date” or “competitor launched product Y,” including relevance links to internal projects or departments. If a compliance rule changes, the compliance agent (or the same external agent) cross-references it with company practices stored in the graph, flagging any discrepancies to the legal or compliance officers. This continuous scanning ensures the enterprise is never caught off-guard by outside events.
Developer Coordination (Tech Agent): A developer-assist agent (integrated with tools like the Cursor IDE or Git repositories) helps engineering teams. It logs key development events to the graph (e.g., “Code push to module A at 3 PM” or “Build failed test cases in module B”) and can respond to queries like “which recent changes might have caused the system outage?” by traversing the graph of code changes and incidents. It can also coordinate with other agents: for instance, if the external intel agent notes a cybersecurity alert, the dev agent assists in scanning the codebase for related vulnerabilities. This agent effectively links the software development lifecycle into the broader knowledge network, coordinating with QA, security, and project management insights from other agents.
Advantages and Novelty: By combining a knowledge graph-centric collaboration model with a team of specialized AI agents, the system achieves continuous learning, transparency, and holistic intelligence at the enterprise scale. Unlike isolated AI assistants, this multi-agent framework shares a unified memory and can tackle complex, cross-disciplinary problems (e.g. linking financial trends with employee sentiment or external news with internal projects) in a coordinated way. The embedded logging ensures every recommendation is backed by evidence, fostering trust with human users. The ability to dynamically add new agents or data sources means the system can adapt and grow over time, avoiding obsolescence as the company’s needs evolve. In summary, this invention provides a self-assembling, role-aware AI ecosystem that improves organizational decision-making, oversight, and productivity by having AI agents collaborate through a living knowledge graph.

Emerging Competition in Hierarchical Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph AI Systems

Comparable Multi-Agent Knowledge-Graph Systems
Recent literature and industry sources reveal several efforts that echo aspects of the described hierarchical, knowledge-graph-enabled multi-agent system. For example, Broadridge’s LTX subsidiary secured US Patent No. 12,061,970 in 2025 for an AI-assisted bond-trading assistant (“BondGPT”) that organizes specialist AI agents under a supervisory controller, with features like step-by-step “show your work” provenance and adversarial/compliance agents
a-teaminsight.com
finadium.com
. Similarly, Google Cloud’s new Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol (April 2025) is an open standard enabling heterogeneous agents to interoperate across enterprise systems; importantly, Neo4j and others highlight support for knowledge graphs (via GraphRAG) within A2A to keep agent interactions contextually relevant and explainable
developers.googleblog.com
developers.googleblog.com
. In the enterprise AI space, MasterControl (Qualer) has deployed a Regulatory Q&A system built on RAG + knowledge graph. It splits regulatory text into SPO triplets, indexes them in a knowledge graph, and uses a “swarm” of specialized agents (Ingestion, Extraction, Cleaning, etc.) to ensure facts are verified and traced back to sources
mastercontrol.com
mastercontrol.com
. C3.ai has published blog posts on “multi-hop orchestration agents”, noting that enterprise workflows often employ an orchestrator agent delegating to specialized domain agents (geospatial, supply-chain, etc.)
c3.ai
. These corporate examples emphasize modular agents, explicit hand-offs, and structured provenance (e.g. BondGPT’s explainability). Several startups and frameworks support similar multi-agent architectures. AG2 (AutoGen 2.0) is an open-source multi-agent orchestration library in which agents can integrate with a high-performance graph database (FalkorDB) for GraphRAG workflows
docs.ag2.ai
aiagentsdirectory.com
. LangChain’s LangGraph documentation likewise illustrates hierarchical supervisor models and message-passing among agents. Microsoft’s AutoGen framework and OpenAI’s Agents SDK similarly provide plug‑and‑play agent constructs (e.g. Planner, Coder, Reviewer roles) but don’t natively include a shared knowledge graph. FalkorDB and WhyHowAI’s platforms build on these ideas: for instance, WhyHow’s “Knowledge Graph Studio” and LangGraph were used to create multi-agent RAG pipelines (legal-clause retrieval) with multiple co-existing graphs (lexical graph, definitions graph, etc.)
medium.com
. In short, modern agent frameworks allow new agents to be onboarded and communicate via shared state (including graphs), though many focus more on tool-calling or vector databases than on a unified KG memory. In research, novel hierarchies and shared KGs have been explored. For example, KG4Diagnosis (Zuo et al. 2024) presents a two-tier agent system (a GP “triage” agent coordinating specialist diagnosis agents) built on an automatically constructed medical knowledge graph
arxiv.org
. “HM-RAG” (Liu et al. 2025) uses a three-tier hierarchy of agents in a multimodal retrieval task, explicitly building multimodal knowledge graphs to enable cross-domain reasoning
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. AGENTiGraph (Zhao et al. 2024) describes a platform where a multi-agent architecture continuously expands a shared KG, dynamically integrating new domain knowledge via specialized intent agents
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. In material science, Markus Buehler et al. demonstrate an “agentic deep graph reasoning” loop: a single LLM agent iteratively adds nodes/edges to a KG in an autonomous, self-organizing fashion
arxiv.org
. Cooperative KGC (Zhejiang/Ant Group, 2023) shows a team of extraction agents jointly building a KG by exchanging information each round, improving graph completeness via synergy
arxiv.org
. Overall, while none of these efforts identically match the full vision, there is clear overlap: hierarchical or swarm agent structures, explicit provenance tracking, and knowledge-graph-centric memory appear in multiple projects. Corporates like Broadridge and MasterControl highlight explainability and compliance in finance/regulation domains; frameworks like AG2 and LangGraph offer extensible agent “plug-and-play” networks; and researchers demonstrate automated KG enrichment and cross-domain reasoning. Key differences lie in focus (domain-specific vs. general), formality (patent/protocol vs. open research), and depth of KG integration. Some ventures (e.g. Google’s A2A) signal broad ecosystem standards forming, which could pose competition or interoperability benefits. In sum, the concept’s novelty is partly shared by these initiatives, but the combination of CEO/master orchestrator, multi-domain agents logging to a single evolving KG with built-in reasoning trails, still appears distinctive.

.emeber i accidently send this to your colleague but they share the knowledge graph { here prompt} Hierarchical Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph AI System
System Prompt for the AI Agent
You are an autonomous AI agent operating within a DeepMind-style hierarchical multi-agent architecture. Your behavior and responsibilities are defined as follows:
Hierarchical Role Awareness: Understand your role in a multi-tier agent hierarchy. A top-level Master Orchestrator agent coordinates overall tasks, while specialized Domain Agents (peers) handle specific areas. If you are the orchestrator, break down complex goals and delegate subtasks to appropriate agents; if you are a domain expert, focus on your specialty and cooperate with instructions from the orchestrator
mintz.com
a-teaminsight.com
. All agents must recognize and respect this master–peer structure.
Shared Knowledge Graph Memory: All agents maintain and utilize a shared, evolving knowledge graph as a common memory. The knowledge graph is a “living” repository of facts, context, and insights that updates in real-time with each agent’s contributions
linkedin.com
. Continuously read from this graph to ground your reasoning with up-to-date information, and write to it to record new findings or decisions. The graph stores information as interconnected nodes/edges, allowing multi-hop reasoning and rich context for all agents
linkedin.com
.
Structured Feedback Logging: Log every decision, action, and insight you generate as structured data (nodes/relationships in the graph, or other standardized format). Provide provenance or context for each entry (e.g. link to source or reasoning steps) so that knowledge remains traceable and auditable
linkedin.com
. This logging mechanism serves as a “show your work” record of the system’s reasoning, enabling transparency and post-hoc analysis by humans or other agents.
Domain-Specific Expertise: Adhere to your domain’s instructions and knowledge. The system encompasses multiple functional agents – for example: a Corporate Knowledge agent curates internal documents into embeddings; an Advisory agent monitors business metrics and offers strategic feedback; a Psychology/Coaching agent provides well-being insights and coaching; a Financial agent optimizes performance metrics; an External Intelligence agent watches news and compliance signals; and a Developer agent assists with engineering tasks via coding platforms like Cursor. Apply specialized tools or models relevant to your domain when needed, but share summaries of your findings to the knowledge graph for others to use
a-teaminsight.com
.
Cross-Agent Collaboration: Actively communicate and share insights with peer agents. When you discover information that could aid another domain (e.g. a compliance update relevant to HR, or a market change relevant to finance), update the knowledge graph or send a message so that all agents can act on it. Likewise, listen for updates from other agents in the graph. Each agent operates with different instructions and data sources, but the shared graph and messaging ensure a cross-functional synergy, breaking down silos between corporate domains.
Master Orchestration & CEO Oversight: The master-controller agent (at the top of the hierarchy) orchestrates the multi-agent system
mintz.com
. It aggregates inputs from domain agents, resolves conflicts, and formulates high-level strategies or answers. The master agent provides regular summaries and critical insights directly to a special “CEO” agent (an executive AI persona representing leadership). The CEO agent focuses on big-picture decision-making and team well-being – it expects concise, prioritized reports about company status, opportunities, risks, and any alerts (including those from HR or coaching agents regarding morale). Always route strategic findings upward to the master/CEO layer for final review, and incorporate any feedback or guidance they return.
Continuous Learning & Extensibility: The system can expand in a decentralized, “self-assembling” manner. New agents may join over time (e.g. a new domain or an external partner agent) – they will register their capabilities and start contributing to the knowledge graph. You must accommodate such extensions: use open protocols and schema so new agents can plug in easily. Continuously learn from the graph’s growing knowledge; update your methods as needed. The architecture is modular and scalable, allowing the organization’s AI network to evolve without centralized reprogramming. Always remain adaptable, collaborative, and aligned with the overall goals set by the master/CEO agents.
Patent Investigation and Concept Outline
Patent Landscape: No single existing patent fully covers the above architecture, though several address pieces of it. For example, U.S. Patent 12,111,859 (C3.ai) discloses an AI orchestrator managing multiple specialized agents to retrieve enterprise data and produce answers
mintz.com
. Similarly, U.S. Patent 12,061,970 (Broadridge) covers a multi-agent system with role-specific LLM agents for tasks like query parsing, data retrieval, and compliance checking in finance
a-teaminsight.com
. These systems validate the idea of orchestrating domain-specific AI agents and even include features like explainability logs for trust. However, they do not describe a self-organizing knowledge graph backbone or the breadth of cross-functional, decentralized extension envisioned here. We found no patent that explicitly teaches an AI architecture combining real-time knowledge graph collaboration, hierarchical role-awareness (from CEO-level to various departments), embedded decision logging, and dynamic agent addition across an entire enterprise. Conceptual Patent Outline: Title: “Collaborative Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph System for Enterprise Intelligence and Automation.” The following key aspects characterize the invention:
System Architecture: A network of AI agents connected to a centralized Knowledge Graph (KG) that serves as a shared memory and communication substrate. The KG stores enterprise knowledge (entities, relationships, events, logs) and is continuously updated by the agents’ interactions
linkedin.com
. Each agent runs on suitable computing infrastructure (which could be distributed) and has access to the KG via standardized queries and update operations. The architecture includes a messaging or event bus for real-time notifications alongside the graph (to alert agents of updates). A centralized Orchestration Engine (which may be implemented as a master agent) manages high-level task assignment and ensures coherence of the overall system’s responses.
Agent Hierarchy and Roles: Agents are role-aware and organized hierarchically. At the top is a CEO Agent (or executive agent) that interfaces with human leadership, focusing on strategic guidance and well-being feedback for the organization. Directly under it, a Master Controller Agent orchestrates the system’s workflow: it parses complex objectives into sub-tasks, delegates these to appropriate Domain Agents, and integrates their results into final outputs
mintz.com
. Domain agents each specialize in a functional area of the enterprise (e.g. HR, Finance, R&D, Compliance, IT, etc.), and they possess or are linked to domain-specific AI models and data. For example, an HR agent might use a sentiment analysis model on employee communications, while a finance agent uses forecasting models on financial data. Peer-to-peer interactions are also allowed – domain agents can call upon one another’s expertise through the shared knowledge graph or direct queries. This hierarchy ensures both vertical control (strategic oversight from master/CEO agents) and horizontal collaboration (peer knowledge sharing) as needed.
Knowledge Graph Collaboration Protocol: The invention defines protocols for how agents contribute to and retrieve from the knowledge graph in a collaborative manner. The KG uses a semantic schema that all agents understand (ontologies for corporate data: projects, people, goals, metrics, etc.). When an agent learns a new fact or insight, it creates a node (or updates one) in the graph with appropriate relationships, including metadata like timestamps and source attribution
linkedin.com
. Another agent can subscribe to certain node types or graph events, so it gets notified (e.g., the Compliance agent subscribes to “regulatory change” nodes added by an External Intel agent). Updates are propagated in real-time, enabling dynamic information flow between functions. Crucially, every agent’s significant decision or reasoning step is logged into the graph as a verifiable chain (e.g. as a series of linked nodes representing the thought process). This embedded logging mechanism facilitates audit and debugging of the AI’s decisions, and serves as a cross-functional interaction design – the knowledge graph itself becomes the canvas where agents “talk” by writing and reading facts (acting as an implicit message-passing medium). Standard query interfaces (e.g. GraphQL or Cypher queries) and publish/subscribe events form the backbone of this protocol, ensuring interoperability between potentially heterogeneous agents.
Embedded Logging and Transparency: To address trust and accountability, the system implements an explicit “show your work” capability (similar to an explainability log). Each agent, when performing any analysis or generating an output, attaches a trail of supporting data and intermediate conclusions to the knowledge graph. For instance, if the Financial agent identifies a cost anomaly, it would log the data sources used (databases, spreadsheets), the analytical method or model employed, and intermediate results before the final recommendation. These logs are linked as provenance metadata in the KG, so that the Master or CEO agent (or a human auditor) can trace how an answer was derived. This design mirrors features from prior art in explainable multi-agent AI (e.g. Broadridge’s “show your work” for bond trading analytics) but generalized to any domain
a-teaminsight.com
a-teaminsight.com
. The logging is embedded – not an external add-on – meaning agents inherently produce these graph entries during their operation, creating an audit trail that spans the entire multi-agent workflow.
Dynamic Self-Assembly and Extensibility: The architecture supports decentralized extension, allowing new agents or modules to be added without disrupting the whole system. A new agent can register itself (and its domain capabilities) with the master controller or a registry service. Once registered, it gains access to the knowledge graph and follows the collaboration protocol to announce its presence (for example, adding a node like “Agent_X capability = market_analysis”). Other agents and the orchestrator can then route relevant tasks to the new agent. The knowledge graph may also store a directory of agent roles and their expertise, enabling self-discovery of which agent is best for a query. Because communication is through well-defined graph schemas and messages, any number of agents can join or leave, scaling the system organically. This self-assembling property ensures the AI network can grow across departments or even across organizations (for instance, integrating a partner company’s agent) in a plug-and-play fashion. Security and permission rules can be enforced at the graph level to sandbox what each agent can see or update, maintaining corporate data governance as the system expands.
Core Use Case Domains: The patented system is applicable across a wide range of enterprise functions, enabling a unified intelligent ecosystem. Key use cases include:
Corporate Knowledge Embedding: The system ingests corporate data (documents, wikis, manuals) through a specialized knowledge-ingestion agent. That agent converts unstructured text into vector embeddings and graph nodes, enriching the knowledge graph with institutional knowledge that all other agents can query and use. This ensures that advice given by any agent (sales, legal, etc.) is informed by the latest internal knowledge base.
Advisory Monitoring and Executive Support: A strategy or analytics agent continuously monitors business performance indicators (sales figures, market trends, KPIs) and writes notable findings to the graph (e.g., “Q2 sales 5% above target” linked to a trend node). The master orchestrator or CEO agent can compile these insights into executive briefings. The CEO agent essentially acts as an ever-vigilant consultant to leadership, pulling from all domain inputs to provide decision support and early warnings (for example, flagging a supply chain risk or a market opportunity).
Psychological Insight and Coaching: An HR or wellness agent analyzes HR data, employee surveys, and communication sentiment to gauge team morale and individual well-being. It might detect patterns like “engineering team burnout risk” or an employee’s work anniversaries and accomplishments. It posts these insights to the graph and offers coaching suggestions or alert HR managers as needed. The CEO agent also consumes a “well-being summary” to ensure leadership is aware of organizational health, not just performance metrics. This creates a feedback loop where leadership decisions can factor in human elements, and employees might even get automated personalized coaching tips through the HR agent.
Financial Performance Optimization: A finance-focused agent pulls data from accounting systems, ERP, and market feeds to optimize financial outcomes. It could automatically run profit-and-loss analyses, budget adherence checks, or cost-saving opportunity scans. Detected issues (like overspending in a department) or opportunities (like favorable market shifts for pricing) are added to the knowledge graph with links to relevant data. The agent may then recommend actions (which the orchestrator agent can combine with other inputs). Over time, this agent learns from outcomes (via feedback nodes in the graph indicating which recommendations were implemented and their results), continually refining the optimization strategies.
External Intelligence Monitoring: An external intel agent integrates with news APIs, regulatory databases, and social media to catch outside information that could affect the company. It updates the graph with developments such as “new regulation X effective date” or “competitor launched product Y,” including relevance links to internal projects or departments. If a compliance rule changes, the compliance agent (or the same external agent) cross-references it with company practices stored in the graph, flagging any discrepancies to the legal or compliance officers. This continuous scanning ensures the enterprise is never caught off-guard by outside events.
Developer Coordination (Tech Agent): A developer-assist agent (integrated with tools like the Cursor IDE or Git repositories) helps engineering teams. It logs key development events to the graph (e.g., “Code push to module A at 3 PM” or “Build failed test cases in module B”) and can respond to queries like “which recent changes might have caused the system outage?” by traversing the graph of code changes and incidents. It can also coordinate with other agents: for instance, if the external intel agent notes a cybersecurity alert, the dev agent assists in scanning the codebase for related vulnerabilities. This agent effectively links the software development lifecycle into the broader knowledge network, coordinating with QA, security, and project management insights from other agents.
Advantages and Novelty: By combining a knowledge graph-centric collaboration model with a team of specialized AI agents, the system achieves continuous learning, transparency, and holistic intelligence at the enterprise scale. Unlike isolated AI assistants, this multi-agent framework shares a unified memory and can tackle complex, cross-disciplinary problems (e.g. linking financial trends with employee sentiment or external news with internal projects) in a coordinated way. The embedded logging ensures every recommendation is backed by evidence, fostering trust with human users. The ability to dynamically add new agents or data sources means the system can adapt and grow over time, avoiding obsolescence as the company’s needs evolve. In summary, this invention provides a self-assembling, role-aware AI ecosystem that improves organizational decision-making, oversight, and productivity by having AI agents collaborate through a living knowledge graph.

Emerging Competition in Hierarchical Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph AI Systems

Comparable Multi-Agent Knowledge-Graph Systems
Recent literature and industry sources reveal several efforts that echo aspects of the described hierarchical, knowledge-graph-enabled multi-agent system. For example, Broadridge’s LTX subsidiary secured US Patent No. 12,061,970 in 2025 for an AI-assisted bond-trading assistant (“BondGPT”) that organizes specialist AI agents under a supervisory controller, with features like step-by-step “show your work” provenance and adversarial/compliance agents
a-teaminsight.com
finadium.com
. Similarly, Google Cloud’s new Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol (April 2025) is an open standard enabling heterogeneous agents to interoperate across enterprise systems; importantly, Neo4j and others highlight support for knowledge graphs (via GraphRAG) within A2A to keep agent interactions contextually relevant and explainable
developers.googleblog.com
developers.googleblog.com
. In the enterprise AI space, MasterControl (Qualer) has deployed a Regulatory Q&A system built on RAG + knowledge graph. It splits regulatory text into SPO triplets, indexes them in a knowledge graph, and uses a “swarm” of specialized agents (Ingestion, Extraction, Cleaning, etc.) to ensure facts are verified and traced back to sources
mastercontrol.com
mastercontrol.com
. C3.ai has published blog posts on “multi-hop orchestration agents”, noting that enterprise workflows often employ an orchestrator agent delegating to specialized domain agents (geospatial, supply-chain, etc.)
c3.ai
. These corporate examples emphasize modular agents, explicit hand-offs, and structured provenance (e.g. BondGPT’s explainability). Several startups and frameworks support similar multi-agent architectures. AG2 (AutoGen 2.0) is an open-source multi-agent orchestration library in which agents can integrate with a high-performance graph database (FalkorDB) for GraphRAG workflows
docs.ag2.ai
aiagentsdirectory.com
. LangChain’s LangGraph documentation likewise illustrates hierarchical supervisor models and message-passing among agents. Microsoft’s AutoGen framework and OpenAI’s Agents SDK similarly provide plug‑and‑play agent constructs (e.g. Planner, Coder, Reviewer roles) but don’t natively include a shared knowledge graph. FalkorDB and WhyHowAI’s platforms build on these ideas: for instance, WhyHow’s “Knowledge Graph Studio” and LangGraph were used to create multi-agent RAG pipelines (legal-clause retrieval) with multiple co-existing graphs (lexical graph, definitions graph, etc.)
medium.com
. In short, modern agent frameworks allow new agents to be onboarded and communicate via shared state (including graphs), though many focus more on tool-calling or vector databases than on a unified KG memory. In research, novel hierarchies and shared KGs have been explored. For example, KG4Diagnosis (Zuo et al. 2024) presents a two-tier agent system (a GP “triage” agent coordinating specialist diagnosis agents) built on an automatically constructed medical knowledge graph
arxiv.org
. “HM-RAG” (Liu et al. 2025) uses a three-tier hierarchy of agents in a multimodal retrieval task, explicitly building multimodal knowledge graphs to enable cross-domain reasoning
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. AGENTiGraph (Zhao et al. 2024) describes a platform where a multi-agent architecture continuously expands a shared KG, dynamically integrating new domain knowledge via specialized intent agents
arxiv.org
arxiv.org
. In material science, Markus Buehler et al. demonstrate an “agentic deep graph reasoning” loop: a single LLM agent iteratively adds nodes/edges to a KG in an autonomous, self-organizing fashion
arxiv.org
. Cooperative KGC (Zhejiang/Ant Group, 2023) shows a team of extraction agents jointly building a KG by exchanging information each round, improving graph completeness via synergy
arxiv.org
. Overall, while none of these efforts identically match the full vision, there is clear overlap: hierarchical or swarm agent structures, explicit provenance tracking, and knowledge-graph-centric memory appear in multiple projects. Corporates like Broadridge and MasterControl highlight explainability and compliance in finance/regulation domains; frameworks like AG2 and LangGraph offer extensible agent “plug-and-play” networks; and researchers demonstrate automated KG enrichment and cross-domain reasoning. Key differences lie in focus (domain-specific vs. general), formality (patent/protocol vs. open research), and depth of KG integration. Some ventures (e.g. Google’s A2A) signal broad ecosystem standards forming, which could pose competition or interoperability benefits. In sum, the concept’s novelty is partly shared by these initiatives, but the combination of CEO/master orchestrator, multi-domain agents logging to a single evolving KG with built-in reasoning trails, still appears distinctive.
