# Executive Summary: Semant Multi-Agent Platform

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Investor-Ready  
**Confidentiality**: Internal Use

## Problem Statement

Enterprises struggle to build production-ready AI agent systems because:

- **Complexity**: Building agent coordination from scratch takes 6-12 months
- **No Intelligence Layer**: Agents don't learn or retain knowledge across workflows
- **Fragmented Tools**: Multiple vendors, no unified platform
- **Scalability Issues**: Systems break under production load

**Result**: 70% of AI agent projects fail or never reach production.
