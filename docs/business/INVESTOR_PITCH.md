# 🎯 Semant: Investor Pitch Deck

**Multi-Agent Orchestration Platform with Knowledge Graph Intelligence**

---

## The Problem

Enterprises struggle to build AI agent systems because:
- **Complexity**: Building agent coordination from scratch takes 6-12 months
- **No Intelligence Layer**: Agents don't learn or retain knowledge
- **Fragmented Tools**: Multiple vendors, no unified platform
- **Scalability Issues**: Systems break under load

**Result**: 70% of AI agent projects fail or never reach production.

---

## Our Solution

**Semant** is the first enterprise-grade platform combining:
1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Dynamic agent creation and coordination
2. **Knowledge Graph Intelligence** - Semantic data layer that learns
3. **Workflow Automation** - Transaction-based task management
4. **Enterprise Integrations** - Google Cloud, Vertex AI, Gmail, Midjourney

**Think**: "LangChain + Neo4j + Airflow" in one platform.
