# Developer Guide

## Best Practices

### Code Reuse and Search
Before writing new code, always search for existing implementations first. This helps:
- Avoid duplicating functionality
- Maintain consistency across the codebase
- Leverage existing tested and optimized solutions
- Reduce technical debt

To search for existing code:
1. Use the codebase search tools to find relevant implementations
2. Check for similar functionality in related modules
3. Review the imports and dependencies of existing code
4. Consider extending or modifying existing code rather than creating new implementations

### Code Organization
- Keep related functionality together in appropriate modules
- Follow the established project structure
- Use clear and consistent naming conventions
- Document code with clear comments and docstrings

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass before committing changes
- Add integration tests for cross-module functionality
- Maintain test coverage for critical paths

### Documentation
- Update documentation when making significant changes
- Include examples in docstrings
- Keep README files up to date
- Document any new dependencies or requirements

### Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Create feature branches for new development
- Review code before merging
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### Performance
- Profile code for performance bottlenecks
- Optimize critical paths
- Consider caching strategies
- Monitor memory usage

### Security
- Follow security best practices
- Validate input data
- Handle sensitive information appropriately
- Keep dependencies updated

### Collaboration
- Communicate with team members about changes
- Review and provide feedback on pull requests
- Share knowledge and best practices
- Maintain clear documentation for team processes
