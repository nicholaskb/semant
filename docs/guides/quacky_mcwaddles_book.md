*SPLASH! SPLASH! BELLY-FLOP!*

Down by the sparkly pond lived a little yellow duckling named Quacky McWaddles.

Quacky had the BIGGEST orange feet you ever did see!
*Waddle-waddle-SPLAT!*

**[Page 2 - Right]**

"Watch me do my SUPER SPLASH!" shouted Quacky.

He ran fast as he could... 
*THUMP-THUMP-THUMP* went his big feet!

*KER-SPLASH!*

"Oopsie! That was more of a belly-flop!" giggled Quacky.
"But it was still QUACK-A-DOODLE-AWESOME!"

## **Pages 3-4: The Big Feet Problem**

**[Page 3 - Left]**

One morning, Quacky looked at his feet.
Then he looked at the other ducklings' feet.
Then he looked at his feet again.

"Holy mackerel!" gasped Quacky. "My feet are ENORMOUS!"

The other ducklings waddled by perfectly.
*waddle-waddle-waddle*

But when Quacky tried...
*Waddle-waddle-TRIP-SPLAT!*

**[Page 4 - Right]**

"*Giggle-giggle!*" laughed the other ducks. 
"Quacky's got clown feet!"

Quacky's one sticky-up feather drooped sadly.

"I know!" he suddenly quacked. "I'll find the Wise Old Goose!
She'll know how to shrink my silly feet!"

And off he waddled... *SPLAT-SPLAT-SPLAT!*

*[Count with Quacky: How many steps before he trips? 1... 2... 3... WHOOPS!]*

## **Pages 5-6: The Waddly Journey**

**[Page 5 - Left]**

Through the meadow went Quacky McWaddles.
*SPLAT! SPLAT! SPLAT!* 
His big feet made the funniest sounds!

"What's that noise?" asked Freddy Frog, hopping over.
He looked at Quacky's feet and his eyes went *BOING!*

"Are you wearing FLIPPERS?" croaked Freddy.

**[Page 6 - Right]**

"Nope!" said Quacky. "These are my regular feet!
They're just a teensy bit... GIGANTIC!"

"Cool!" said Freddy. "Can you swim super fast?"

"I don't know," said Quacky. "Right now they just make me go
*Waddle-waddle-SPLAT!*"

Freddy laughed so hard he fell off his lily pad!
*SPLASH!*

"Different is terrific!" croaked Freddy as Quacky waddled away.

*[Action Time: Show me YOUR silly walk!]*

## **Pages 7-8: The Tangled Mess**

**[Page 7 - Left]**

"Oh no!" quacked Quacky.
His big feet got tangled in the reedy grass!

He pulled and tugged...
*TUG-TUG-TUG!*

"These feet were made for swimming!" he grunted.
"Not for getting stuck in grass like spaghetti!"

**[Page 8 - Right]**

Quacky had an idea! 
If he couldn't walk... he'd HOP!

*BOING! BOING! BOING!*

"I'm hopping like a bunny!" laughed Quacky.
"No wait - I'm doing the WADDLE HOP!"

*Left foot forward - SPLAT!*
*Right foot forward - SPLAT!*
*Both feet together - HOP!*

"This is QUACK-A-DOODLE-AWESOME!" 

Three curious bunnies stopped to watch and started copying him!

## **Pages 9-10: The Wise Old Goose**

**[Page 9 - Left]**

At the top of the hill sat the Wise Old Goose.
She wore tiny spectacles on her beak.

"Honk-hello, young Quacky!" she smiled.
"I see you've invented a new dance getting here!"

"Wise Old Goose," panted Quacky,
"How do I shrink my ENORMOUS feet?"

**[Page 10 - Right]**

The Wise Old Goose adjusted her spectacles.
"Shrink them? Oh my stars, no!"

She pointed to the pond below with her wing.
"Those magnificent feet will make you the FASTEST swimmer in all the pond!"

"Really?" gasped Quacky, his sticky-up feather perking up.

"Your differences are your SUPERPOWERS, young quacker!
Now... WADDLE-HOP back and show them what you can do!"

"QUACK-A-DOODLE-AWESOME!" shouted Quacky.

## **Pages 11-12: The Happy Splashy Ending**

**[Page 11 - Left]**

Quacky WADDLE-HOPPED all the way back!
*SPLAT-SPLAT-HOP! SPLAT-SPLAT-HOP!*

"Who wants to RACE?" he called to the other ducklings.

Into the pond they dove!
Quacky's big feet went *ZOOM-ZOOM-ZOOM!*

He swam so fast, he made a WAVE!
"These feet were made for SWIMMING!" he cheered.

**[Page 12 - Right]**

Quacky won the race by a MILE!
All the ducklings cheered!

"Teach us the Waddle Hop!" they begged.

So Quacky taught them all his silly dance:
*"SPLAT-SPLAT-HOP! Now wiggle your tail!
SPLAT-SPLAT-HOP! Now flap without fail!"*

Even his reflection "Splashy" joined in!

And from that day on, Quacky McWaddles knew:
Being different wasn't just okay...
It was QUACK-A-DOODLE-AWESOME!

**THE END**
