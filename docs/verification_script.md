# Agent System Verification Script

## Documentation Verification

### 1. Core Documentation Files
```bash
# Check if all required documentation files exist
ls -l docs/developer_guide.md
ls -l docs/technical_architecture.md
ls -l README.md
```

### 2. Documentation Content Verification
```bash
# Check for key sections in each file
grep -n "## " docs/developer_guide.md
grep -n "## " docs/technical_architecture.md
grep -n "## " README.md
```

### 3. Code-Documentation Alignment
```bash
# Check for documented components in code
grep -r "class " agents/ --include="*.py"
grep -r "def " agents/ --include="*.py"
```

## Implementation Verification

### 1. Core Components
```bash
# Check core agent components
ls -l agents/core/
ls -l agents/domain/
ls -l agents/utils/
```

### 2. Test Coverage
```bash
# Run test suite with coverage
pytest tests/ -v --cov=agents
```

### 3. Code Quality
```bash
# Run linting
flake8 agents/
pylint agents/
```

## Verification Checklist

### Documentation
- [ ] All core components are documented
- [ ] All public APIs are documented
- [ ] All configuration options are documented
- [ ] All error handling is documented
- [ ] All examples are up to date

### Implementation
- [ ] All core components are implemented
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] All linting checks pass
- [ ] All type hints are correct
- [ ] All error handling is implemented

### Integration
- [ ] All components integrate correctly
- [ ] All dependencies are documented
- [ ] All configuration is documented
- [ ] All deployment steps are documented

## Usage

1. Copy and paste each section into your terminal
2. Check the output against the checklist
3. Document any issues found
4. Update documentation and implementation as needed

## Example Verification Output

```bash
# Example output format
Component: AgentRegistry
Documentation: ✓
Implementation: ✓
Tests: ✓
Integration: ✓

Component: AgentFactory
Documentation: ✓
Implementation: ✓
Tests: ✓
Integration: ✓

# etc...
```

## Verification Process

1. Run documentation verification
2. Run implementation verification
3. Run test suite
4. Run code quality checks
5. Update documentation and implementation
6. Re-run verification

## Notes

- Keep this script updated as new components are added
- Add new verification steps as needed
- Document any issues found during verification
- Update documentation and implementation as needed
