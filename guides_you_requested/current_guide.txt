IKGRC 2023 – International Knowledge Graph Reasoning Challenge 2023 (JSAI/SWO, co-located
with IEEE ICSC 2023) . Task: Given 8 Sherlock Holmes mystery scenarios encoded as RDF
knowledge graphs, identify the culprit in each and provide reasoning. Data: RDF KGs of mystery
stories; participants reason over graph structures. Evaluation: accuracy of culprit identification and

KGRC4SI 2024 – Knowledge Graph Reasoning Challenge for Social Issues (Safety of Older
Adults) (JSAI SWO, Japan) . Task: Answer reasoning queries about daily activities in elderly
home environments. Two tasks: Task 1 uses a complete activity knowledge graph, Task 2 uses an
incomplete KG; each has 8 natural-language questions (e.g. “What action did he take after entering
the kitchen?”) . Data: VirtualHome2KG simulated daily-activity videos plus aligned knowledge
graphs (RDF/TTL), describing events (actions, objects, times) . Evaluation: Submission is a
JSON answer file; scored by accuracy of answers. Overall ranking also considers technical ingenuity
and explanation quality . Dates: Application by Dec 25, 2023; final presentations Feb 9, 2024.

SemTab 2024 – Semantic Web Tabular Data to Knowledge Graph Matching (ISWC 2024) .
Task: Annotate web tables with KG semantics. Subtasks include: CTA (assign a fine-grained DBpedia
class to each column), CEA (link each cell to a Wikidata entity), CPA (assign a property between
column pairs), RA (assign a row to a KG entity) . Data: CSV tables from web/academic sources,
with ground-truth annotations (Wikidata/DBpedia). Evaluation: Standard multi-class metrics
(precision/recall) and specialized scoring (“cscore” for type hierarchy distance) . Dates:
Co‑located with ISWC 2024 (Nov 2024). (Info: SemTab 2024 challenge description .)
SemTab 2023 – Semantic Web Challenge (ISWC 2023) . Task and setup similar to SemTab
2024 (CTA, CEA, CPA, etc.) . Data: web tables annotated with DBpedia/Wikidata. Evaluation:
classification accuracy/cscore on gold annotations. Dates: ISWC 2023.
Scholarly QALD 2023 (ISWC 2023) – Scholarly QA over Linked Data . Two QA tasks: (1) DBLP-QUAD
– answer natural-language questions over the DBLP bibliographic KG (10K Q/SPARQL pairs) ; (2)
SciQA – comparative QA over the ORKG scholarly knowledge graph . Data: The DBLP-QUAD and
ORKG-QA datasets (SPARQL gold answers). Evaluation: Accuracy/F1 of returned answers (exact
match to SPARQL results). (Hosted on CodaLab .)
Lux AI Season 3 (NeurIPS 2024 Competition) . Host: Kaggle (Lux AI challenge). Task: Develop
1v1 multi-agent RL agents for a resource-management strategy game (grid-based “Lux” game). Data:
Simulated game environment (each agent controls multiple units). Evaluation: Head-to-head
matches on a Kaggle leaderboard (Trueskill ranking) . Dates: Season 3 ran in 2024 (NeurIPS 2024
competition track) .

Concordia Contest 2024 (NeurIPS Cooperative AI Track) . Host: Cooperative AI Foundation
(with Google DeepMind, MIT, UC Berkeley, etc). Task: Build one language-model (LM) agent to
maximize “cooperative intelligence” across diverse text-based scenarios (based on the Concordia
framework). Agents interact in open-ended RPG-like worlds requiring promise-keeping, negotiation,
reciprocity, etc. . Data: Concordia text environment framework and scenarios. Evaluation:
Submissions are scored by average reward in multiple modes (self-play and cross-play) . Dates:
Dev phase Sept 18–Oct 31, 2024; evaluation Nov 2024 .
Maritime Capture-the-Flag (MCTF) Competition 2024 (AAMAS 2024) . Host: AAMAS 2024.
Task: Multi-agent RL for a 3v3 naval Capture-the-Flag game. Teams submit 3-agent Python bots to
jointly defend/capture flags in a simulated maritime environment . Data: RLlib-based simulation
environment (continuous-time naval battle). Evaluation: Team score in matches (points for captures/
flag returns). Timeline: Qualifying online Feb–Apr 2024; finals held at AAMAS 2024 (results
announced mid-2024) .
International Planning Competition 2023 – HTN Tracks (ICAPS 2023) . Host: International
Conf. on Automated Planning & Scheduling (ICAPS). Task: Solve planning problems under
Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) models. Tracks: Total-order vs. partial-order HTN planning, with
“Agile” (fast satisficing) vs. “Satisficing” vs. “Optimal” scoring regimes . Data: HTN planning
domains (PDDL with methods). Evaluation: Planners scored by tasks solved and plan cost (detailed
scoring rules provided) . Dates: Contest ran June 2023; results announced July 2023 .
Topic-Conversation Relevance (TCR) 2024 (NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks) . Task: Determine if
segments of workplace meeting transcripts are on-topic with the meeting agenda. Data: 1,500 real/
augmented meetings (22M words of transcript, ~15k topic labels) from diverse domains .
Evaluation: Model accuracy on held-out set (the authors benchmarked with GPT-4). Released 2024
.
FinBen 2024 (Financial Benchmark for LLMs) (NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks) . Host: NeurIPS

multi-lingual). Data: 42 datasets covering 24 tasks (English/Chinese finance). Evaluation: Task-specific
metrics (e.g. QA accuracy, trade profit, etc.) . Released 2024.
BHI 2024 Data Challenge – “AI in Medicine: Privacy, Explainability, Trustworthiness” .
Host: IEEE EMBS Biohealth Informatics conference 2024. Two tracks: (1) Synthetic Data Generation:
Given 100 patients’ wearable-activity sensor data (physical activity sequences), generate new
synthetic data that mimics the originals . Evaluation (Track1): 30% by qualitative expert review
(GATEKEEPER framework criteria: innovation, transparency, etc.) and 70% by quantitative similarity
metrics (Wasserstein, KS, JS, correlation) . (2) Explainable AI for Healthcare: Given a pretrained
multimodal glucose-prediction model and Physiobank data, apply explainability methods and
analyze model behavior . Evaluation (Track2): 100% qualitative expert assessment focusing on
explanation quality (AI Gatekeeper criteria) . Dates: BHI 2024 event (April 2024).
