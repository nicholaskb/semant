Objective: Implement a multi-agent scientific reasoning framework for prompt refinement.

Step 2: Implement Specialized Analysis Agents
- Implemented the agents responsible for breaking down and analyzing the inputs.
- Each agent is a subclass of `BaseAgent` and performs one specific task.

Files Created/Modified:
- `agents/domain/logo_analysis_agent.py`: Analyzes images for logos and distinct graphical elements.
- `agents/domain/aesthetics_agent.py`: Describes the overall aesthetic, mood, and style of the images.
- `agents/domain/color_palette_agent.py`: Identifies the dominant color palette.
- `agents/domain/composition_agent.py`: Analyzes the composition, layout, and relationship to the original prompt.

Next Step: Implement the synthesis and review agents.
