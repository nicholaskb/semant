Objective: Implement a multi-agent scientific reasoning framework for prompt refinement.

Step 3: Implement Synthesis and Review Agents
- Implemented the agents responsible for synthesizing the analyses into a new prompt and then reviewing it.

Files Created/Modified:
- `agents/domain/prompt_synthesis_agent.py`: Synthesizes the analyses from the specialist agents into a new prompt.
- `agents/domain/prompt_critic_agent.py`: Critiques the synthesized prompt for clarity and effectiveness.
- `agents/domain/prompt_judge_agent.py`: Makes a final judgment on whether the refined prompt is an improvement.

Next Step: Implement the PlannerAgent and the workflow.
