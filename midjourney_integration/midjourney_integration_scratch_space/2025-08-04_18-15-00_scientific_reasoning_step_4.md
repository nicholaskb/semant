2025-08-04 18:15:00 - Scientific Reasoning Framework - Step 4 Complete

Objective: Implement a multi-agent scientific reasoning framework for prompt refinement.

Step 4: Implement the PlannerAgent and the Workflow
- Implemented the `PlannerAgent`, which is the core of the new framework.
- The agent dynamically creates and executes a multi-step workflow using the `WorkflowManager`, defining the dependencies between the analysis, synthesis, and review agents.

Files Created/Modified:
- `agents/domain/planner_agent.py`: Orchestrates the entire prompt refinement process.

Next Step: Integrate the workflow into the main API.
