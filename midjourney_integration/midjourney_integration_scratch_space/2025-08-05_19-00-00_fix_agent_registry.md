Objective: Fix the `AttributeError` that is preventing the application from starting.

Issue: The application fails on startup with `AttributeError: 'AgentRegistry' object has no attribute 'get_all_agents'`.

Root Cause: A previous step incorrectly modified `main.py` to call the `get_all_agents` method on the `AgentRegistry` instance, but this method was never implemented in the `AgentRegistry` class.

Fix: Add the following method to the `AgentRegistry` class in `agents/core/agent_registry.py`:

```python
    def get_all_agents(self) -> List[BaseAgent]:
        """Returns a list of all initialized agent instances."""
        return list(self._agents.values())
```

Status: Waiting for user to apply the fix before proceeding.
