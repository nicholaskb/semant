Objective: Fix the `TypeError` that occurred during the test script execution.

Issue: The test script failed with `TypeError: WorkflowManager.create_workflow() missing 1 required positional argument: 'required_capabilities'`.

Root Cause: The `PlannerAgent` was not declaring the capabilities required by its workflow, and the specialist agents did not have their specific capabilities defined.

Fix:
1.  **Assigned Capabilities**: Added a unique `capability` to the constructor of each of the new scientific reasoning agents (`LogoAnalysisAgent`, `AestheticsAgent`, `ColorPaletteAgent`, `CompositionAgent`, `PromptSynthesisAgent`, `PromptCriticAgent`, `PromptJudgeAgent`).
2.  **Updated PlannerAgent**: Modified the `PlannerAgent` to gather all the required capabilities and pass them to the `workflow_manager.create_workflow` method.

This ensures the `WorkflowManager` is aware of all the agent skills needed to execute the plan.

Status: Fix applied. Ready to re-run the test script.
