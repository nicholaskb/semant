Objective: Fix the `ValueError` and `AttributeError` that occurred during the test script execution.

Issue: The test script failed with `ValueError: 'logo_analysis' is not a valid CapabilityType` and a subsequent `AttributeError` because the logger was not initialized.

Root Cause:
1. The new capabilities (e.g., "logo_analysis") were defined as plain strings, but the `BaseAgent` expects them to be members of the `CapabilityType` enum.
2. The `BaseAgent` constructor attempted to log a warning about the invalid capability before the `self.logger` attribute was created.

Fix:
1.  **Updated `capability_types.py`**: Added all the new scientific reasoning capabilities to the `CapabilityType` enum, making them valid and recognizable.
2.  **Updated `base_agent.py`**: Moved the `self.logger` initialization to be one of the first lines in the `BaseAgent` constructor, ensuring it is available for any subsequent logging.

Status: Fix applied. Ready to re-run the test script.
