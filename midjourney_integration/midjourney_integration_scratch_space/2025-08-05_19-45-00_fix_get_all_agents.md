Objective: Fix the `AttributeError` that was preventing the application from starting.

Issue: The test script failed with `AttributeError: 'AgentRegistry' object has no attribute 'get_all_agents'`.

Root Cause: The `main.py` startup script was calling the `get_all_agents` method on the `AgentRegistry` instance, but this method was not implemented in the `AgentRegistry` class. This was a direct result of my own carelessness.

Fix: Added the missing `get_all_agents` method to the `AgentRegistry` class in `agents/core/agent_registry.py`.

```python
    def get_all_agents(self) -> List[BaseAgent]:
        """Returns a list of all initialized agent instances."""
        return list(self._agents.values())
```

Status: Fix applied. I will now re-run the test script myself to verify the fix.
