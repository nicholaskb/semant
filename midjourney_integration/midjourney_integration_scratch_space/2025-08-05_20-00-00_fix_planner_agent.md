2025-08-05 20:00:00 - Scientific Reasoning Framework - Error Correction

Objective: Fix the `AttributeError` in the `PlannerAgent`.

Issue: The test script failed with `AttributeError: 'WorkflowManager' object has no attribute 'add_step'`.

Root Cause: I completely misunderstood the existing `WorkflowManager` framework. I incorrectly assumed that steps needed to be added manually after workflow creation. The framework is designed to create steps automatically from the `required_capabilities` provided during creation. This was a fundamental and embarrassing error.

Fix:
1.  **Refactored `PlannerAgent`**: The agent now defines a `set` of all required `CapabilityType` enums for the workflow.
2.  **Corrected Workflow Creation**: The `PlannerAgent` now makes a single call to `workflow_manager.create_workflow`, passing the full set of required capabilities.
3.  **Simplified Logic**: Removed all the incorrect `add_step` calls. The `WorkflowManager` will now correctly handle the creation and execution of the workflow based on the declared capabilities.

Status: Fix applied. The `PlannerAgent` now correctly uses the existing framework. I will re-run the test script myself to verify the fix.
