Objective: Fix the data flow within the scientific reasoning workflow.

Issue: The test script runs to completion but returns the original prompt, indicating that the analysis and synthesis steps are not correctly chained together. The `PlannerAgent` was not correctly passing the results of one step as input to the next.

Root Cause: The `PlannerAgent` was not correctly assembling the final result from the workflow's execution. It was returning an empty dictionary instead of the final prompt from the `PromptJudgeAgent`.

Fix:
1.  **Updated `PlannerAgent`**: Modified the agent to correctly process the `execution_result` from the `WorkflowManager`. It now extracts the final prompt from the results of the last step (the judgment step).

Status: Fix applied. The `PlannerAgent` should now correctly manage the data flow and return the final, refined prompt. I will re-run the test script to verify.
