2025-08-05 20:30:00 - Scientific Reasoning Framework - Complete

Objective: Implement a multi-agent scientific reasoning framework for prompt refinement.

All steps are now complete:
1.  **✓ Create New Agent Files**: All agent files were created.
2.  **✓ Implement Specialized Analysis Agents**: All analysis agents were implemented.
3.  **✓ Implement Synthesis and Review Agents**: All synthesis and review agents were implemented.
4.  **✓ Implement the PlannerAgent and the Workflow**: The `PlannerAgent` and its workflow were implemented and corrected.
5.  **✓ Integrate the Workflow into the Main API**: The main API now uses this new framework.
6.  **✓ Test and Verify**: The framework was tested and verified using a dedicated script, `examples/demo_scientific_refinement.py`.

The system is now fully functional and robust.
