Objective: Document the new scientific reasoning framework in the `midjourney_integration/README.md`.

- Updated the "Core Features" section to include the new "Scientific Prompt Refinement" feature.
- Removed the "Known Issue" about the non-functional "Refine with AI" button.
- Added a new section, "Refining the Prompt with AI," to the user workflow guide.
- Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the list of required environment variables.

This completes the final step of the implementation. The framework is now fully implemented, tested, and documented.
