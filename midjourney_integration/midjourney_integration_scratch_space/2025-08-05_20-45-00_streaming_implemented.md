2025-08-05 20:45:00 - Scientific Reasoning Framework - Streaming Implemented

Objective: Implement real-time streaming of agent interactions to the frontend.

1.  **Enhanced `PlannerAgent`**: The `PlannerAgent` in `agents/domain/planner_agent.py` was modified to accept an optional `streaming_callback` function. It now calls this function at each step of the workflow, providing real-time updates of its progress.

2.  **Created Streaming API Endpoint**: The `/api/midjourney/refine-prompt` endpoint in `main.py` was converted to a streaming endpoint using FastAPI's `StreamingResponse`. It now passes a callback to the `PlannerAgent` and yields the agent's updates as Server-Sent Events (SSE).

3.  **Updated Frontend**: The JavaScript in `static/midjourney.html` was updated to:
    *   Use the `EventSource` API to connect to the new streaming endpoint.
    *   Add a new UI element (`#refine-status`) to display the stream of thoughts from the agents.
    *   Listen for a special `final_prompt` event to receive the final result and close the connection.

Status: All changes have been implemented. The UI will now display a live stream of the scientific reasoning workflow when the "Refine with AI" button is clicked.
