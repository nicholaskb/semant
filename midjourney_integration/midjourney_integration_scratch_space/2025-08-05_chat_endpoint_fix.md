### Fix Chat Endpoint TypeError - 2025-08-05_03-52-52

**Issue:** The '/chat' endpoint was failing with a 'TypeError' because the 'MainAgent.handle_chat()' method was called without the required 'openai_client' argument.

**Root Cause:**
- 'main.py': The 'api_chat' endpoint did not pass the 'openai_client' when calling '_main_agent.handle_chat'.
- 'main_agent.py': The 'handle_chat' method unnecessarily required 'openai_client' as a parameter, even though the 'MainAgent' class initializes and stores its own client instance ('self.openai_client').

**Fix:**
1.  **Refactored 'main_agent.py'**:
    -   Removed the 'openai_client' parameter from the 'handle_chat' method signature.
    -   Updated the method to use the internal 'self.openai_client' for all OpenAI API calls.
2.  **No Changes in 'main.py'**: The calling code in 'main.py' now works as-is without modification.

**Outcome:** This change resolves the 'TypeError' and simplifies the 'MainAgent' by making it self-contained. The chat functionality should now work as expected.
