### Fix Image Handling in Analysis Agents - 2025-08-05_15-50-16

**Issue:** The analysis agents ('LogoAnalysisAgent', 'AestheticsAgent', 'ColorPaletteAgent', 'CompositionAgent') were failing with 'openai.BadRequestError: ... invalid_image_url' because they were passing public GCS URLs directly to the OpenAI API, which could not access them.

**Root Cause:** The OpenAI API cannot access public URLs directly. The image data needs to be downloaded and sent as a base64-encoded string.

**Fix:**
1.  **Added '_create_error_response' to 'BaseAgent'**:
    -   Added a new method to 'agents/core/base_agent.py' to create standardized error response messages.
2.  **Modified Analysis Agents**:
    -   Updated the '_process_message_impl' method in 'LogoAnalysisAgent', 'AestheticsAgent', 'ColorPaletteAgent', and 'CompositionAgent'.
    -   The agents now download the image data from the URL, encode it in base64, and send the raw data to the OpenAI API.
    -   Added 'httpx' and 'base64' to the imports of each agent.

**Outcome:** The analysis agents are now able to correctly process images by sending the raw image data to the OpenAI API, bypassing any permission issues with the URL.
