## 2025-08-06_21-45-00_fix_agent_initialization_error

**Objective:** Resolve the `Agent not initialized. Call initialize() first.` error during application startup.

**Issue:**
- The application was crashing on startup with an error pointing to the `_auto_discover_agents` method in `agents/core/agent_registry.py`.
- The error message indicated an agent was being used before its `initialize()` method had completed.
- The error was specifically triggered when discovering agents in `agents/domain/simple_agents.py`.

**Investigation:**
1.  **Analyzed `agent_registry.py`:**
    - The `_auto_discover_agents` method scans for `BaseAgent` subclasses in Python files.
    - For each discovered agent class, it attempts to create an instance by calling `AgentClass(agent_id="some_uuid")`.

2.  **Analyzed `simple_agents.py`:**
    - The agent classes in this file (e.g., `FinanceAgent`, `CoachingAgent`) had constructors that did not accept any arguments (e.g., `__init__(self, agent_id: str = "default_id")`).
    - This created a signature mismatch. The auto-discovery mechanism was passing an `agent_id` keyword argument, but the constructors were not explicitly designed to accept it in that manner, leading to an instantiation failure.

**Fix:**
1.  **Modified `agents/domain/simple_agents.py`:**
    - Updated the constructors for `FinanceAgent`, `CoachingAgent`, `IntelligenceAgent`, and `DeveloperAgent` to accept `**kwargs`.
    - For example: `def __init__(self, agent_id: str = "finance_agent", **kwargs):`
    - This change makes the constructors more flexible and allows them to accept the `agent_id` passed by the auto-discovery process without failing.

**Outcome:**
- The agent classes in `simple_agents.py` are now compatible with the auto-discovery mechanism.
- The application should no longer raise an initialization error on startup.
