# 2025-08-06 23:00:00 - V7 Image URL Download Failures

## Problem Pattern
Multiple jobs failing with V7 when using Google Cloud Storage URLs for image prompts.

## Failed Job Analysis
Task ID: 7ade7281-def4-474a-9ea6-ecb5ebd4875b
- Version: V7
- Image URLs: 3 GCS URLs used as image prompts
- Error: "Invalid link\nTimeout while downloading this image"
- All URLs are from: `https://storage.googleapis.com/bahroo_public/`

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. V7 Specific Issues
- V7 may have stricter requirements for image URLs
- V7 may have different timeout settings
- V7 may not handle multiple image URLs well

### 2. GCS Access Issues
- Midjourney's servers may be having trouble accessing GCS
- GCS may be rate-limiting or blocking Midjourney's IP ranges
- CDN propagation delays

### 3. URL Format Issues
- V7 might require specific URL formats
- The combination of multiple URLs might be problematic

## Recommendations

### Immediate Workarounds
1. **Use V6 instead of V7** when using image prompts from GCS
2. **Try single image** instead of multiple images
3. **Use alternative image hosting** (Imgur, Discord CDN, etc.)

### Code Improvements Needed
1. Add warning when using image URLs with V7
2. Auto-fallback to V6 when image prompts are detected
3. Add retry logic with different versions
4. Validate image accessibility before submission

## Testing Strategy
1. Test same prompt with V6
2. Test with single image URL
3. Test with non-GCS image hosting
4. Test with shorter/simpler URLs
