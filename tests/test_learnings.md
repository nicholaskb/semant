# Test Failures and Solutions

## 1. KeyError: 'original_body'
**Root Cause**: The `VertexEmailAgent.send_email` method was not storing both `original_body` and `enhanced_body` in the sent_emails list when using Vertex AI.

**Solution**: Updated the `send_email` method to store both the original and enhanced versions of the email body when using Vertex AI. Added a conditional check to only store these fields when the model is present.

## 2. ValidationError: timestamp
**Root Cause**: The `AgentMessage` model requires a timestamp field, but it was not being provided in test cases.

**Solution**: Updated all test cases to include a timestamp in `AgentMessage` constructions using `datetime.now().isoformat()`. This ensures the message model validation passes.

## 3. Judge Agent Approval Logic
**Root Cause**: The Judge Agent's approval logic was not properly checking for email existence in the knowledge graph.

**Solution**: Implemented a new `evaluate_email` method in the Judge Agent that:
- Checks if the knowledge graph is initialized
- Queries the knowledge graph for the email using SPARQL
- Approves the email if found in the knowledge graph
- Rejects the email if not found or if an error occurs

## General Learnings
1. Always ensure model validation requirements are met in test cases
2. When storing enhanced versions of content, maintain both original and enhanced versions
3. Implement proper error handling and logging for better debugging
4. Use SPARQL queries to verify data existence in knowledge graphs
5. Consider default behaviors when dependencies (like knowledge graph) are not available

## Additional Learnings (2024-05-30)
- Always use 'await' for async agent methods in tests to avoid coroutine errors and ensure proper execution.
- Patch or mock dependencies (like the knowledge graph) in tests to provide required methods (e.g., .query) so agent logic can be tested in isolation.
- When refactoring to async or changing method signatures, update all usages in tests and codebase.

## Next Steps
1. Add more comprehensive test cases for edge cases
2. Implement proper email enhancement logic in VertexEmailAgent
3. Add more detailed logging for debugging
4. Consider adding retry mechanisms for knowledge graph operations
